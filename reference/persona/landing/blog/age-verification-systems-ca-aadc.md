Key takeaways

The CA AADC is a law geared toward tech companies that provide online services likely to be accessed by children under age 18. 

Though the CA AADC only applies to California businesses, several other states have introduced similar legislation. 

If your business offers services including games, music, TV and movie streaming services, pop culture content, social media, voice-assistants, or news, it’s likely that a significant number of children and teenagers access your site and the AADC may apply to you.
