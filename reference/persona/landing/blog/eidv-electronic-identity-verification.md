Key takeaways

Electronic identity verification (eIDV) is the act of verifying a person’s identity digitally or electronically — whether through a computer or a mobile device.

eIDV employs many of the same strategies as manual, in-person identity verification, but also allows you to collect a wide swath of additional details and risk signals.

Benefits of eIDV include scalability, faster processing time, and more.
