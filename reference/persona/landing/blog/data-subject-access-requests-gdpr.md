Key takeaways

Individuals in a growing number of jurisdictions have a right to privacy as well as a right to access personal data about themselves. 

The GDPR requires that companies and organizations subject to it establish a process for receiving and responding to requests from users and customers seeking to know what information about them is kept on file and how it is used.  

Companies have a responsibility to take requests seriously or risk hefty fines, business impacts, and reputational risk.
