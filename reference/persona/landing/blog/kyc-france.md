Key takeaways

France has several agencies managing AML requirements, depending on the industry.

KYC rules mandate identity documentation for individuals and businesses;  remote verification has simplified the process while continuing to uphold increased security of personal information and adherence to EU privacy rules.

Failure to comply with financial regulations can range from fines to prison terms as well as dissolution of a company.
