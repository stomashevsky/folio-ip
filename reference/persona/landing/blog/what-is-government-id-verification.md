Key takeaways

Government ID verification is the process of requesting, analyzing, and validating a piece of government-issued identification, such as a driver’s license or passport.

You can scrutinize the document for signs of fraud, and, in some circumstances, verify the information against the issuing agency’s database.

Although it can offer a high level of assurance, you may not want to solely rely on government ID verification to vet users.
