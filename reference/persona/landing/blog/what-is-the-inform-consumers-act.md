The INFORM Consumers Act is a law that requires online marketplaces to collect certain information about sellers earning a certain level of revenue to make it easier for regulators and investigators to investigate suspected fraud.

The SHOP Safe Act is a piece of proposed legislation that would make online marketplaces liable for copyright and trademark infringement in cases where a third party uses their platform to sell counterfeit goods with the potential to harm the health or safety of the customer, such as cosmetics, supplements, and pharmaceuticals.
