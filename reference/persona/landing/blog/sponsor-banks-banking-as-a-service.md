Key takeaways

Banking as a Service (BaaS) is a model that allows fintechs to offer financial products and services without acquiring a banking license by partnering with a licensed bank (aka a sponsor bank).

Both the bank and fintech should conduct extensive due diligence on each other to properly mitigate risks and ensure compliance with federal and state regulations.

Partnering with RegTech vendors can help you operationalize your compliance program, build to scale, and fulfill regulatory requirements.
