Key takeaways

Protected health information (PHI) refers to specific types of medical information that can be tied back to an individual person, which is collected or used by healthcare providers and other entities covered by HIPAA.

HIPAA's Security Rule requires covered entities to implement physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to protect against any threat considered “reasonably anticipated.”

Some ways you can remove risks from your patient identity verification process include working with a HIPAA-compliant IDV provider, automating as much of your IDV process as possible to reduce the possibility of inappropriate access, and partnering with an IDV solution that will store PII for you.
