Key takeaways

In addition to financial institutions' legal requirement to continuously monitor for suspicious activity, it’s also their duty to create and file a suspicious activity report (SAR) whenever they suspect that fraud, money laundering, or financial crimes are taking place.

SARs must be filed within 30 days of the suspicious transaction.

SARs are highly confidential — the individual who discovers the activity isn't required to disclose their name or contact information, and the filer is prohibited from disclosing information that could reveal the report's existence.
