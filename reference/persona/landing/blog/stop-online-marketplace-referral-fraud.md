Key takeaways

Referral programs can help you grow your online marketplace, but they also attract bad actors — individuals or groups — who want to reap the rewards without referring legitimate new users. 

With a combination of fraud detection and identity verification tools, you can automate onboarding and selectively add friction to protect yourself from various types of marketplace fraud, including referral fraud.

Using link analysis, you can uncover fraudulent accounts hiding in your user base and gain insights to strengthen your fraud protections.
