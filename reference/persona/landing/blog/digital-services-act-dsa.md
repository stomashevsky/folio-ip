Key takeaways

The Digital Services Act (DSA) created a new, unified legal framework for online intermediaries and platforms that operate in the EU. It’s designed to protect users and combat illegal content online, including the sale of illegal products and services.

The DSA’s requirements vary depending on the types of services a company offers and its size. However, many of the principles apply to all platforms.

If your platform hosts sellers or traders of goods or services, you must collect and verify information about those users to comply with the DSA. 

You may need to implement effective age assurance methods to restrict access to adult or harmful content that may be posted or shared on your platform.
