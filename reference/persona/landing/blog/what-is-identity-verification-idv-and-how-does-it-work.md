Key takeaways

Identity verification is the process of confirming that somebody is who they say they are. It typically occurs during the onboarding process, and then in an ongoing fashion as necessary.

Not all businesses are required to verify their customers, but any business that operates online can benefit from implementing IDV processes.

Identity verification methods include documentary verification, digital ID verification, database verification, and selfie verification.
