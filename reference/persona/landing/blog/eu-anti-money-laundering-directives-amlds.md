Key takeaways

AMLDs require any institution that handles financial transactions in EU member states (called “obliged entities”) to apply minimum due diligence checks, such as identity verification and transaction monitoring, upon entering into new business relationships.

In total, the European Parliament has passed six AMLDs, each building off of and superseding the last.

The sixth EU AMLD added cybercrime, environmental crime, and “aiding and abetting” to the list of activities that are considered money laundering. It also increased the sentence for money laundering crimes to a minimum of four years’ imprisonment.
