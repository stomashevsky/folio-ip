Key takeaways

To date, no reusable identity has succeeded in comprehensively addressing companies’ compliance and flexibility needs while offering the privacy and security assurances end users desire.

Reusable Personas, Persona’s reusable identity, offers the best of both worlds by allowing users to seamlessly store and reuse their verified PII via Passkey while enabling businesses to holistically evaluate risk without sacrificing the user experience.

This allows companies to seamlessly maintain their risk assurance with their unique set of checks and step up or step down verifications via .
