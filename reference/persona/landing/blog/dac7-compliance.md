Key takeaways

The DAC7 directive requires digital platform operators in the EU, such as marketplaces, websites, and apps that allow sellers to connect with buyers, to collect and report personal and business information on income realized by sellers using their platforms for certain commercial services.

Even platforms not based or registered in an EU member state that sell to individuals based in the EU fall under the DAC7 reporting requirements.

DAC7 is focused on ensuring that all taxes — income tax as well as value-added tax (VAT) — are reported and assessed.
