Key takeaways

Common examples of PEPs include heads of government, senior politicians, and other public officials. People connected to these individuals, such as their family members and close associates, may also be considered PEPs.

Each country is free to establish its own definition of who they consider to be a politically exposed person (PEP). As such, there is no single database or list that contains all PEPs. 

Generally, foreign PEPs are considered to pose a higher risk of money laundering due to the possibility that the financial institution performing the PEP check may be less familiar with the political landscape of a foreign PEP’s country of origin.
