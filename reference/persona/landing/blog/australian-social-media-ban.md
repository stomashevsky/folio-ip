Key takeaways

Australia’s Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024, sometimes referred to as a social media ban, requires some social media platforms to prevent Australians younger than 16 from having an account.

The law is expected to be fully enforced by the end of 2025, giving platforms a year to design compliance strategies. 

If a platform intends to collect a user’s government-issued ID (including digital IDs) to determine their age, it must also provide alternative methods that are not dependent on the user having an ID. 

Platforms are also required to destroy any information collected for age assurance once a determination has been made.

Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to significant fines of up to 49.5 million (Australian dollars).
