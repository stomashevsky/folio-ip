Key takeaways

Colleges and universities can streamline account recoveries by collecting and verifying identifying information from students, alumni, and faculty online. 

Using identity verification tools and automation can enable legitimate users to quickly recover their accounts without hands-on help from IT staff.

Risk and fraud checks can help detect bad actors who are attempting to take over an account. These account recovery requests can then be denied or routed to manual review on a case-by-case basis.
