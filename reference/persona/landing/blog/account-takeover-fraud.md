Key takeaways

Account takeover (ATO) fraud occurs when a bad actor gains access to an account that doesn’t belong to them — typically because the account’s login credentials have been compromised in some way.

While ATO fraud most commonly targets accounts belonging to individuals, corporate account takeover (CATO) fraud also occurs when a bad actor targets an account belonging to a business or organization.

ATO fraud, whether it targets your business or customers, can lead to financial losses as well as damage to your brand’s reputation and customer trust.

Implementing two-factor or multi-factor authentication, understanding what’s normal for your customers, and leveraging identity verification and reverification can all help you reduce instances of ATO fraud on your platform.
