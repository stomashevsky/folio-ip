Key takeaways

Fraudsters increasingly turn to generative AI models to create assets and media — including text, images, video, and audio — to use in their attacks.

In this way, generative AI (GenAI) enables fraudsters to iterate faster and carry out larger attacks with greater sophistication than was previously possible.

Implementing a holistic fraud strategy helps you create overlapping layers of protection against GenAI fraud and empowers you to contain the damage when a fraudster gets through.
