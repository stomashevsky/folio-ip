Key takeaways

Fraud rings are groups of two or more people who work together to commit fraud. 

Large fraud rings have the time and resources to launch sophisticated attacks, which they can quickly scale once they find a way past your defenses. 

Organizations can use link analysis and risk-based identity verifications to help identify and stop fraud rings.
