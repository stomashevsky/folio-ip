Key takeaways

Online businesses that verify or estimate a user’s age must also take care to ensure that any data they collect and store is adequately protected and secured.

A number of laws, such as GDPR, COPPA, OSA, and CCPA/CPRA, require organizations to ensure data security.

Businesses can keep their age assurance processes secure by minimizing unnecessary data collection, ensuring data is appropriately encrypted, offering multiple age verification methods to security-conscious users, and working with a verification provider capable of securely storing PII.
