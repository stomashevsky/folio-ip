Key takeaways

An Ultimate Beneficial Owner, or UBO, is any person who owns a significant portion of a company.

Identifying and verifying UBOs is an essential part of the Know Your Business (KYB) process.

If your company operates in the financial space, you are legally required to complete UBO checks as part of AML protocols.
