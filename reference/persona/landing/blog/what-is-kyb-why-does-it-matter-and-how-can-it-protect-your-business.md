Key takeaways

KYB involves verifying the legitimacy of any business your company works with, whether that business is a customer, vendor, supplier, contractor, or partner.

The two primary goals of KYB are to determine if a business is real and legitimate and whether engaging with them would pose a risk to your company. 

KYB can be completed in a number of different ways, but it often involves a mix of business document verification and identity verification for the company’s ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs).
