Key takeaways

Your organization’s data reserves are a treasure trove for bad actors to target and potentially exploit. You have a responsibility to your patients to ensure any information you collect and store — on or off the cloud — is protected from prying eyes.

Cloud service providers (CSPs) come in three main forms: IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS. Each typically serves different roles for an organization, and it’s possible for a single healthcare organization to employ multiple CSPs from multiple categories.

To help safeguard your patients’ data when leveraging cloud-based solutions, understand who is responsible for securing the data and adopt a robust IAM framework for your organization.
