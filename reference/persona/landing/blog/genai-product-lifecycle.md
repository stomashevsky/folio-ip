Key takeaways

Generative AI (GenAI) might introduce new threats, but even the most sophisticated fraudsters will still rely on the same underlying tactics and tools.

Collaboration between product and fraud teams is essential for creating a risk assessment that takes into account how GenAI could affect fraud for a particular product. 

Regularly review your processes and user flows to determine what changes or new processes could help you defend against GenAI-powered fraud attacks.
