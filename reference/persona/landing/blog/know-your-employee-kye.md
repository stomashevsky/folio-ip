Key takeaways

Know Your Employee (KYE) refers to the processes a business uses during the hiring and onboarding process, and throughout an employee’s employment, to ensure that they are who they say they are.

KYE is required by law for certain regulated industries, such as banks, but it can also offer benefits to businesses operating in other industries where it isn’t required. 

An identity verification (IDV) tool can help you with certain parts of the KYE process, especially if you are already leveraging IDV for other uses such as KYC or fraud prevention.
