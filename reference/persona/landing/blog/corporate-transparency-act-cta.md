Key takeaways

On January 1, 2024, the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) went into effect, requiring some businesses in the United States to report beneficial ownership information (BOI). 

The main purpose of the act was to create a federal beneficial ownership registry that improved transparency and made it more difficult for criminals to engage in illegal activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, through shell corporations.

On March 26, 2025, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) adopted an interim final rule that exempts US companies and US persons from BOI reporting requirements. Previously filed BOI reports don’t need to be updated or corrected. 

With some exceptions, foreign businesses still must comply with the requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act or face penalties for noncompliance.

Once built, the beneficial ownership database will be accessible by financial institutions, law enforcement professionals, and certain government agencies.
