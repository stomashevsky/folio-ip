Key takeaways

Remote Know Your Business (KYB) onboarding is increasingly the go-to method for banks and financial institutions to meet regulatory requirements for new customers.

The primary purpose of KYB is to identify Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) of business customers. UBOs must then undergo an identity verification, or a Know Your Customer (KYC) review. 

The pandemic helped fast-track regulations allowing KYB to be adopted by global companies needing the ability to easily and safely collect, review, and verify documentation digitally.
