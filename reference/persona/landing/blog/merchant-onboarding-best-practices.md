Merchant onboarding is a set of processes that payment service providers undertake to gauge the risk posed by a merchant before doing business with them.

The process involves Know Your Business (KYB) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, as well as risk assessment and ongoing monitoring.

When designing your merchant onboarding processes, consider the role automation might play in helping you scale, and leverage multiple forms of verification for added peace of mind.
