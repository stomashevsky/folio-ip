Key takeaways

Reverification is the process of re-verifying the identity of a customer or user who has already verified their identity.

It can be a good idea to reverify customers when they change key account information, documents expire, the user initiates a high-risk action, and more.

Reverification is a requirement for some industries, and it can also protect your company and customers.
