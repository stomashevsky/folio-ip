Key takeaways

There’s a growing consensus worldwide about the risks social media poses to the well-being of children and teens.

Public opinion is encouraging lawmakers to propose stricter requirements for social media companies to protect minors online.

Currently, no standard legal requirements for age verification exist for social media platforms as there are for other age-restricted industries, such as alcohol and tobacco. However, regulators are placing increased scrutiny on these sites to ensure due diligence.  

Social media platforms are increasingly implementing more robust and secure age verification systems, moving beyond basic self-attestation to actual age verification.
