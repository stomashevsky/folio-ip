Key takeaways

AML transaction monitoring refers to the processes a business implements to monitor customer transactions in order to identify suspicious activity that may be tied to money laundering activities or other financial crimes.

Broadly speaking, any business deemed a financial institution under the Bank Secrecy Act (and related laws) is subject to AML transaction monitoring requirements.

Virtually any transaction completed through a financial institution must be monitored for suspicious activity, including cash deposits and withdrawals, other deposits, check cashing, money orders, traveler's check sales, fund transfers, ACH activity, currency transactions, wallet-to-wallet crypto transfers, and more.
