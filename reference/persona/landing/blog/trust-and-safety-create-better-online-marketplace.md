Key takeaways

Trust is an integral part of all online platforms. Without customer trust, users will not want to use your platform. For online marketplaces, this means buyers and sellers won’t want to complete transactions.

Fraud and harassment on your platform can directly damage customer trust.

Identity verification, reverification, two-factor authentication, and link analysis can all help you combat fraud and preserve user trust.
