Digital identity verification is the process of verifying a person’s identity via digital means, typically in a remote setting.

This type of verification can involve multiple methods, including government ID verification, database verification, selfie verification, and link analysis.

Digital verification helps businesses achieve compliance, establish trust with users and customers, and prevent fraud on their platforms.
