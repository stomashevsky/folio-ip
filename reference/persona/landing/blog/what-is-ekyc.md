Key takeaways

Electronic KYC (eKYC) is the process of completing identity verification and other KYC requirements digitally.

eKYC can pull from a broader variety of data and signals than is typically available with traditional KYC, including active signals, third-party data, passive signals, and behavioral signals.

eKYC offers businesses increased processing speed, reduced workload, scalability, and fewer human errors. It offers end users convenience, speed, and privacy.
