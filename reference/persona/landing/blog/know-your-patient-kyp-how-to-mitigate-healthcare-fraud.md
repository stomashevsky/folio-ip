Key takeaways

Know Your Patient is the process of verifying patients' identities. It can be leveraged during patient onboarding as well as at other key moments where a patient interacts with an organization.

Patient identity verification and reverification can help protect sensitive patient data, prevent medical identity theft, and more.

When launching a KYP program, consider your verification methods wisely, select a HIPAA-compliant IDV provider, and don't forget to keep the patient experience in mind.
