Key takeaways

A mobile driver’s license (mDL) is a form of electronic identification that encrypts and digitally stores the information found on your physical driver’s license

Before an individual receives a mobile driver’s license, their identity must first be validated by the application that will house the mDL.

mDLs can help reduce the number of asks you make to your customers during the identity verification process, reducing friction and increasing conversions.
