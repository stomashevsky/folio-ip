Key takeaways

Bad actors are using generative AI to create fake IDs and documents. There’s a lot of hype, but it’s not truly novel — it’s just a new implementation of the (very old) fake ID fraud vector. 

The largest impacts can be seen in two areas: unsophisticated fraudsters who now have an easy and inexpensive option for launching more complex attacks, and sophisticated fraudsters who can use GenAI to scale their operations.

Advanced technology can help fraud fighters detect AI-generated IDs, selfies, and documents. But taking a holistic, risk-based approach to fraud detection that relies on various types of data increases your chances of stopping fraud at every angle.
