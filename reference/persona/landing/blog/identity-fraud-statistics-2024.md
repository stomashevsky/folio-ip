Key takeaways

Identity fraud is a top priority for most organizations, and one of the most challenging types of fraud to prevent. 

Most survey respondents feel they can effectively protect their organization when reacting to fraud attacks, but they’re not as confident about proactively getting ahead of the fraudsters.

Generative AI accelerates both known and unknown fraud types, so balancing reactive and proactive solutions may become increasingly challenging when resources are limited.
