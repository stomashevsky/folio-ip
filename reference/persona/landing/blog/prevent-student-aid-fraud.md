Key takeaways

Student aid fraud happens when fraudsters enroll in higher education courses, collect student loans or grants, and then disappear with the money. 

Fraudsters may target schools with online courses, high approval rates, low application fees, and open enrollment. 

Schools can use identity verification to spot bad actors during the application process — before they can affect legitimate students or receive student aid. 

Link analysis can help uncover connected fraudulent student accounts and improve fraud detection.
