Key takeaways

Device fingerprinting is the process of collecting information about a device, which can then be used to identify the device and differentiate it from other devices, and re-identify it later.

Device fingerprinting can be a powerful way to identify and prevent fraud, as it helps businesses understand when a single device is tied to multiple accounts, when a single device is used to open a suspiciously large number of accounts, or when a single device is being used to attempt to log into multiple accounts.
