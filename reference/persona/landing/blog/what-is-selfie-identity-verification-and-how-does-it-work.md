Key takeaways

Selfie identity verification is a verification process that requires a user to take and submit a selfie to match their identity to their government-issued ID.

Selfie checks can help protect against fraud caused by database breaches; they’re also an easy way to reverify users.

While selfie verification is powerful, it's not foolproof. Selfie checks should just be one component of your verification toolkit.
