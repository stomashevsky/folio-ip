Key takeaways

Match requirements refer to the internal logic that you set for determining whether or not a variation of a piece of data (such as aliases, nicknames, alternative spellings, or misspellings) will trigger a “match” when found in a report or other type of verification.

Your match requirements determine how wide you are casting your net as you search for potential matches.

Determining the match requirements for your business will require you to balance friction against security.
