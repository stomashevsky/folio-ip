Key takeaways

Workplace identity proofing is the process of verifying that an applicant, hire, or employee is actually who they say they are.

Implementing identity proofing in the workplace can help you mitigate many types of employment fraud — e.g. remote worker fraud and employment identity theft — as well as account takeovers of legitimate employees. 

Best practices include basing your proofing processes on a thorough risk assessment of your business and leveraging multiple types of verification for comprehensive coverage.
