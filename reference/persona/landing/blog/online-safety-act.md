Key takeaways

The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) and related secondary legislation are intended to help keep the internet safe for children and to give adults more control over their online experiences.

The OSA applies to user-to-user services (e.g., social media and gaming platforms), search services (e.g., search engines and sites with a search function), and pornography services (that publish non-user-generated or -submitted content).

Companies that offer regulated services to UK users may need to comply with the OSA even if they’re not based in the UK. 

To comply, companies may have to complete risk assessments for illegal content, a children’s access assessment, and implement highly effective age assurance measures. 

Ofcom, the regulator that enforces the OSA, shared various age assurance methods that it believes can be highly effective. However, the OSA doesn’t require organizations to use specific technologies or measures to assess age or limit access to age-appropriate content.
