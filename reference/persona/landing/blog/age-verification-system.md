Key takeaways

Digital age verification is complex. At a minimum, you need to handle underage user data compliantly and ensure users can only access age-appropriate products and services on your platform to avoid regulatory fines and legal repercussions. 

You can build your own digital age verification solution, but that would require considerable investment and maintenance with countless new age-related bills proposed around the world. A more efficient option would be to engage an external solution that you can configure to your business’ and users’ needs.
