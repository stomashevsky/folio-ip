Key takeaways

Source of funds is the origin of the money used in a particular transaction, while source of wealth is the origin of all the money a person has accumulated over their lifetime.

SOF and SOW checks are an essential element of KYC measures and part of the AML recommendations laid out by the Financial Action Task Force.

These checks provide your team with a clearer picture of the client’s risk profile and financials and help you investigate suspicious activity and inform future decisions.
