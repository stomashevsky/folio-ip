Key takeaways

A money services business (MSB) is any business that transmits or converts money for its customers or clients.

MSBs are considered financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and are required to implement anti-money laundering (AML) measures.

AML requirements include implementing a risk-based approach, Know Your Customer (KYC) and customer due diligence (CDD) measures, transaction monitoring, and more.
