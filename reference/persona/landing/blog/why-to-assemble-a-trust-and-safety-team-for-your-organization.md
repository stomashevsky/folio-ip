Key takeaways

Trust is especially important for any business that facilitates transactions, such as online marketplaces and other forms of P2P sharing platforms, as these businesses’ entire business model revolves around their ability to provide a safe space for people to complete a transaction.

A trust and safety team is the team within a business  that is charged with promoting a safe environment for the business’s users or customers to engage in.

Trust and safety teams' responsibilities can include moderating content, rooting out fraud, manually reviewing flagged cases, and more.
