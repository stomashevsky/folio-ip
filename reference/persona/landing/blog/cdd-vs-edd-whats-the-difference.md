Key takeaways

Customer due diligence (CDD) refers to a set of KYC processes designed to assess customer risk. It usually involves collecting and verifying personal information about prospective and current customers.

Enhanced due diligence (EDD) refers to protocols that are followed when an individual or transaction is deemed to carry a higher risk of money laundering or other financial crime.

EDD may include processes such as more stringent identity verification, source of funds verification, continuous monitoring, and other screenings.
