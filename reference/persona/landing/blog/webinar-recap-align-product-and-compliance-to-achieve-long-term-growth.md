Key takeaways

Compliance is not a checkbox to be addressed just before a product launches. Align your product and compliance teams from the start of a project through to its completion.

Even with tight alignment between product and compliance, you won’t get it right on the first time because compliance is always evolving. 

When evaluating external resources to assist with compliance, find the right partner and be clear on the expertise and value they bring.
