Key takeaways

An unusual activity report (UAR) is a document that summarizes the details of unusual activity conducted by an account holder, such as an abnormal transaction. 

After a fintech files a UAR with its sponsor bank or other appropriate entity, the bank will determine whether a formal SAR is necessary.

While SARs are a legal requirement for financial institutions, UARs are a newer concept and are not yet legally mandated — though this may change.
