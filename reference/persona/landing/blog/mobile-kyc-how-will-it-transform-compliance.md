Key takeaways

Mobile KYC is the process of verifying someone’s identity via a mobile device such as a smartphone.

Implementing mobile KYC processes can offer you another opportunity to meet your users and customers where they are.

Mobile KYC also empowers you to leverage verification techniques and technologies that are not typically supported by or optimized for desktop verification.
