Key takeaways

In banking, Know Your Customer (KYC) is a three-part process for verifying a potential customer’s identity and assessing their risk.

Key components of the KYC process in banks include a Customer Identification Program (CIP), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), and continuous monitoring.

Best practices in KYC for banks include using progressive risk segmentation to control friction, deploying automation to make it easier to scale, and having a plan for the threats posed by generative AI.
