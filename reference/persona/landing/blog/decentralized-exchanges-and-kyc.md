Key takeaways

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are crypto exchanges designed to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, which reduces transaction costs.

DEXs are much more anonymous than their traditional counterparts — users just need to connect a cryptocurrency wallet to the exchange to get started.

While DEXs aren't subject to KYC/AML regulations right now, many think they will be eventually since crypto exchanges are now regulated.

Even if DEXs aren't subject to KYC/AML regulations in the short term, embracing the key tenets of KYC compliance can benefit the space.
