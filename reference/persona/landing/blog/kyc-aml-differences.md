Key takeaways

AML refers to the steps a financial institution takes to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes from taking place via its platform or products.

KYC refers to the steps that a business undertakes to verify the identities of its customers or users.

Businesses that may seem to be unrelated to the financial industry may actually have KYC requirements after all; some businesses may also have additional KYC requirements that have nothing to do with fighting money laundering.
