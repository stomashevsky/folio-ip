Key takeaways

Effective customer data protection can help you reduce regulatory risk, avoid lawsuits, and safeguard customer trust.

Which information your marketplace should prioritize safeguarding will depend on the specific rules and regulations you're subject to. Some consumer privacy laws to keep in mind include GDPR, CPRA, and state/country-specific regulations.

You can protect sensitive customer data by partnering with an identity solution that safely stores customer data for you, enforcing two-factor authentication, performing reverification, and more.
