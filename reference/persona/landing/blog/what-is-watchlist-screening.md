Key takeaways

A watchlist screening is the process of comparing customer information against the records in a watchlist to understand who that customer is and what risks they might pose to your business. 

Watchlists can come from a variety of sources, and may include sanctions lists, PEP lists, adverse media lists, high-risk jurisdictions lists, terrorist watchlists, and wanted persons lists. 

Watchlist screening is an important part of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activity, and can help businesses limit different types of risk.
