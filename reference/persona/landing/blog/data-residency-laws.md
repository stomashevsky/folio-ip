Key takeaways

If your business collects customer data, data residency laws may dictate or impact where you are allowed (geographically) to store and process that data.

Your vendors, including identity verification, KYC, and cloud-service providers, also need to comply with data residency laws because these companies process your users’ data. 

Partner with providers that align with your data residency compliance strategy so you can continue to focus on your core business when expanding to new regions.
