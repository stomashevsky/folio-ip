Key takeaways

Online passport verification is a type of government ID verification that requires a person to take and upload a picture of their passport’s data page, and possibly a selfie, to verify their identity. 

E-passports also often have near-field communication (NFC) chips that you can use for identity verification if someone also has an NFC-enabled mobile device. The extra security can help prevent passport fraud. 

Although passport verification is required in some instances, it might not be as practical as other types of government ID verification.
