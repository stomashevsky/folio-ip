Key takeaways

Triangulation fraud starts with bad actors offering products for sale on marketplaces, auction sites, and fake ecommerce websites, often for a steep discount. Consumers purchase the products, the bad actor places an order using stolen payment information, and the merchant ships the product directly to the consumer. 

Marketplaces and ecommerce sites may receive a chargeback and have to eat all the costs associated with triangulation fraud. The consumer might never realize what happened. 

Certain risk signals might help you identify fraudsters’ seller accounts and purchases. Link analysis can also help you quickly identifying fraud rings’ accounts and orders to shut down large operations.
