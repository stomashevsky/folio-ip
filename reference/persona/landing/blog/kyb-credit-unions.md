Key takeaways

In order to compete with the big banks and grow your member base, your credit union must offer digital onboarding options for individual and business accounts.

This means having a plan in place to digitally verify the legitimacy of the business and the identities of the business’s ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs), and to conduct ongoing monitoring.

A flexible KYB solution can help your credit union better serve its members — regardless of the type of business entity they are and whether they are domestic or international — while also ensuring you comply with relevant regulations.
