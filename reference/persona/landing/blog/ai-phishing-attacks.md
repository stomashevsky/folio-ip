Key takeaways

With AI phishing, bad actors can use LLM to remove poor grammar, spelling mistakes, and other idiosyncrasies to sound more like a native speaker, luring victims into a false sense of security. 

To protect users and employees, you’ll want everyone to be aware of the extent to which phishing attempts have gotten sophisticated so they can remain vigilant against scams.

LLM makes it easy to continuously change copy, rendering the old ways of blocking a specific string of sentences and words obsolete. You’ll need a more advanced fraud prevention tool that looks at other signals of the fraudster themselves, such as IP address, geolocation, and user ID.
