Key takeaways

Social engineering attacks use manipulation and deception instead of exploiting technical vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to users’ personal information or accounts.

Attackers will employ various tactics to deceive their targets, including pretexting, baiting, phishing, and brandjacking.

A dynamic approach to identity verification and platform security can help prevent social engineering attacks. This involves switching dynamically between different modes of verification, making it harder for fraudsters to anticipate.
