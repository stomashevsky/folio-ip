Key takeaways

KYB (Know Your Business) and KYC (Know Your Customer) are essential due diligence processes that involve verifying the businesses and individuals you want to work with to prevent fraud and ensure regulatory compliance.

While KYC focuses on verifying individuals, KYB delves into understanding the ownership and control structures of businesses and then identifying and verifying each business's ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs).

Implementing robust KYB and KYC programs can significantly reduce the risk of financial crimes, help you avoid costly fines, and protect your reputation by ensuring thorough compliance with regulatory requirements.
