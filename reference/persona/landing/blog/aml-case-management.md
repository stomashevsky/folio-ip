Key takeaways

AML case management is the process through which banks and financial institutions monitor, detect, investigate, and report suspicious customer behavior. 

It is the first layer of defense against financial losses — not only those directly caused by financial crimes but secondarily from the regulatory fines and sanctions that can be levied when companies fail to stop actual and potential crimes.

An optimal case management system is one that is robust enough to meet a company’s many AML needs but dynamic enough to adjust for changing regulatory and relevant criteria while also providing data for measuring its overall effectiveness.
