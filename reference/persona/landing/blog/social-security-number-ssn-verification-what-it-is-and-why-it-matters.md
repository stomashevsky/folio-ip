Key takeaways

SSN verification is important because bad actors often use stolen SSNs to establish fake identities and open fraudulent bank accounts to launder money, evade taxes, and engage in other nefarious activities.

Businesses can verify a person’s Social Security number by checking against various authoritative data sources, using eCBSV validation, or verifying documents that contain the individual's SSN.

As SSNs weren't designed to act as universal identification numbers, SSN verification should be just one part of your identity verification process.
