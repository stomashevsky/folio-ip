Leverage a comprehensive suite of signals and evidence

Collect a wide array of data points and evidence such as user behavior analytics, device identification, identity proofing evidence, and verification data to develop a nuanced understanding of a user's risk profile.

Surface more insights by combining data

No single provider or model can handle all fraud vectors. Use each risk signal collected in order to create an ensemble model - a combination of different models, signals, and algorithms - to detect and pinpoint what’s risky from the data collected.

Analyze your data at the population-level to find connections between bad actors

Examine your data as a whole in order to identify trends, repeat patterns, and anomalies in user behavior that would be indicative of a potential fraud threat and block them immediately.

Use an identity platform that supports active segmentation to make better-informed decisions in real time

By fully leveraging the collected signals and evidence, ensemble models, and population-level insights, you can actively segment users based on their risk level. You can surface the right approach at the right time.
