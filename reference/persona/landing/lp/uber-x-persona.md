A comprehensive set of security policies and trainings are made available and shared with all personnel with access to Persona systems.

Third party audits

In addition to our extensive internal scanning and testing program, we employ third-party security experts to perform penetration tests.

Logical access

Access to production systems is restricted to necessary personnel, is audited and monitored, and is secured with multi-factor authentication.

Internal controls

All employees undergo background checks and are subject to ongoing background checks throughout their employment.

## Privacy

Every decision we make begins with the safety and privacy of you and your customers' data in mind.

Data Transfer

We perform transfers in a secure manner by encrypting data in transit. We are also able to support data residency in the US and the EU.
