Comply with the INFORM Act with minimal engineering resources

Quickly verify sellers with Persona’s native integration with MX, a leading bank account verification provider, so you can meet compliance in days rather than months.

Onboard and reverify more sellers

Minimize friction by adjusting the verification flow in real time based on risk signals, and reverify sellers at any time.

Prepare your marketplace to meet future tax and regulatory requirements

Build verification flows and maintain audit trails that help your marketplace comply with the INFORM Act and DAC7, as well as meet future requirements, such as verifying your sellers earning more than $600.

## Collect business data and documents

Build a custom Know Your Seller flow to collect any business information. Reduce back-and-forth between you and the seller you’re verifying by requesting supplemental documents at any point of the flow.

## Screen sellers in real time

Make better decisions by enriching seller profiles with additional risk signals and verify them with automatic list screenings, like business watchlists and adverse media reports.

## Verify UBOs in the same flow

Automatically send and trigger KYC flows for each ultimate beneficial owner, if needed, reducing friction.

## Find and block hidden fraud rings

With all the data in one place, marketplaces can surface hidden links among sellers on their platform to catch sophisticated fraud rings via link analysis — and automatically block them.

## Designed for best-in-class marketplaces

Get the tools you need to onboard and verify any type of seller on your platform, whether they’re an individual or business, protect buyers, and comply with regulations — all while saving your team time.
