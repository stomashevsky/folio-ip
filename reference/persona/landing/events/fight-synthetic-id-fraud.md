# Fighting synthetic ID fraud: how to incorporate diverse signals into identity verification

Expert discussion on approaches and treatment strategies for fighting synthetic identity fraud

Where does a real ID begin and a fake ID end? Synthetic identity fraud, where real and fake information is combined to create fraudulent identities, can be nearly impossible to detect for this very reason. But while financial institutions have historically borne the brunt of synthetic IDs, fraud teams in every industry must now understand this fraud vector. More importantly, you’ll need to guarantee that every interaction involves a genuine individual without introducing excessive friction into the user experience.

Watch SentiLink's Head of Fraud Insights, David Maimon, and Persona's Jeff Sakasegawa and Irfan Faizullabhoy discuss how to incorporate diverse data points like passive and active signals or link analysis into your onboarding process to address this advanced form of fraud.
