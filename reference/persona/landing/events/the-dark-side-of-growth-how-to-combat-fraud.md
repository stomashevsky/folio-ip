# The dark side of growth: How to combat fraud

How "safety by design" helps marketplaces like Neighbor prepare for and address moments when bad actors are most likely to strike

It’s no secret that as your business succeeds, fraudsters are more likely to target you. Many fraudsters launch large-scale attacks at opportune moments – after announcing a new product launch, new promotions, or even a funding round. The worst part? Fraudsters never strike once or alone — their aim is to inflict as much damage as possible in a short time, often working in fraud rings to commit synthetic or 3rd party identity fraud.‍

Watch this discussion and demo to learn:

-   How Trust and Safety teams think about building a strategy around the principle of "safety by design".
-   Key moments (e.g. product launches and seasonal promos) when fraudsters are most likely to strike — and how to set up fraud deterrents in response.
-   How to use link analysis to quickly combat fraud rings and spot “passive” fraud.
-   Considerations when evaluating link analysis fraud solutions.
