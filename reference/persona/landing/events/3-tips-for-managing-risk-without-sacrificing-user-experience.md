# 3 tips for managing risk without sacrificing user experience

Optimizing for both conversion rates and risk management are key to minimizing fraud, and maximizing conversion. Watch this discussion to learn how to manage risk without sacrificing user experience.

### First impressions with customers matter.

74% will switch to another solution if your onboarding process is too difficult.[1](https://userpilot.com/blog/customer-onboarding-statistics-saas/#:~:text=Successful%20onboarding%20results%20in%20high,the%20onboarding%20process%20is%20complicated.) But with more companies reporting fraud than ever before, you also need to ensure you’re properly managing risk.[2](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/forensics/economic-crime-survey.html)

The issue: the easier you make it for users to become customers, the more risk and fraud you’re likely to face.

Optimizing for conversion rates and managing risk are two ends of a spectrum. Striking the right balance between the two at the right time is the key to minimizing fraud, and maximizing conversion.
