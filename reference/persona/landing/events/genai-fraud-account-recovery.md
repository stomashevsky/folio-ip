# GenAI fraud in account recovery: Strategies for safeguarding employees and customers

As fraudsters leverage generative AI and deepfakes to bypass verification processes or target internal teams, businesses must rethink their account recovery and trust strategies across all aspects of their operations—including both customers and employees. [Case in point](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdnz3elwzvo): North Korean agents were recently caught masquerading as IT workers inside U.S. companies using fake IDs.

This webinar will explore how fraudsters actually use deepfakes and how different verification methods can counter these sophisticated threats. Learn how to build an account recovery framework that not only mitigates risk but also ensures a seamless experience for legitimate users through risk segmentation.
