# Ditch vanity onboarding metrics: Achieve long-term growth

Learn how trust and safety measures like Know Your Customer (KYC) promote long-term growth.

In the past, many startups prioritized growth metrics by unwittingly relying on vanity data, or worse, unverified customer sign-ups and activity, in order to attract investors. Today, we’re seeing a shift in which founders and VCs recognize that intimately understanding their business’ user data provides them with authentic growth metrics, unlocking the key to long-term success.‍

Watch as Jeff Sakasegawa, Trust and Safety Architect at Persona, Hunter Spinks, Head of Product at Bond, Anzar Dewani, BSA/AML Officer at Bond, and Alex Yen, Head of Growth at Persona, discuss the concepts of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) and their impact on tracking business’ authentic growth for long-term success.‍

-   Impacts of KYC (know your customer) and KYB (know your business).
-   Insights into trust and safety processes and their role in verifying customer and business identities.
-   Tips from Persona and Bond on how they successfully implemented KYC and KYB processes to achieve authentic growth.
