# Guide to going global: How Taskrabbit navigated diverse market requirements during international expansion

Marketplace leaders discuss their key learnings from expanding their KYC and KYB programs globally.

All growing marketplaces will need to expand to a new market at some point — but how do you do so effectively and efficiently without tripping over new compliance requirements or unspoken cultural norms? And then how do you do it at scale across more countries and regions?  

Taskrabbit answered these questions during their own expansion across the US and then to the EU, building a global expansion playbook in the process.  Hear detailed insights and lessons from its trust and risk leader, Sidra Khan, along with Jeff Sakasegawa of Persona, who led a risk and compliance team at Square.
