# Third-Party Fraud | Definition & Common Questions

**Third-party fraud** is essentially another term for identity theft. It refers to situations where an individual’s [personally identifiable information (PII)](./personally-identifiable-information-pii.md) is stolen and then used to open or take over an account. Bad actors often engage in third-party fraud to gain access to credit, financial products, or services that would otherwise be unavailable to them — harming both the business and the person whose information they have stolen.
