# Know Your Seller: Definition and FAQs

**Know Your Seller (KYS)** refers to the steps that an online marketplace or auction site takes to verify the identity of the sellers using their platform.

In the United States, online marketplaces are required under the [INFORM Consumers Act](../blog/what-is-the-inform-consumers-act.md) to verify a seller’s name, contact information, bank account details, and tax identification number (SSN, TIN) if that seller:

-   Brings in at least $5,000 in gross revenue in a 365-day period
    
-   Completes at least 200 transactions 
    

Per the law, accepted forms of verification include ID verification, tax document verification, and email/phone verification. Other verification methods can also be leveraged to gain a more comprehensive view of who your sellers are. Although seller verification is only required for high-volume sellers, many online marketplaces have chosen to implement blanket verification of all sellers during onboarding in order to reduce regulatory risk.

The goal of most KYS programs is to reduce the risk of [marketplace fraud](../blog/what-is-marketplace-fraud-and-how-do-companies-stop-it.md) by preventing fraudsters from opening an account. Verification also provides investigators with an auditable trail to follow when fraud is detected.
