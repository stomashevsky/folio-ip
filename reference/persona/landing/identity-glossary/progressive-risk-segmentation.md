# Progressive Risk Segmentation | Definition & FAQs

**Progressive risk segmentation** is a [risk assessment strategy](../guides/the-strategic-guide-to-identity-verification.md) that empowers businesses to dynamically adjust in real time the level of friction a user encounters during identity verification. It does this by coordinating with the collection and analysis of risk signals. This allows a user to automatically move between multiple verification flows — for example, standard [Customer Due Diligence (CDD)](./customer-due-diligence-cdd.md), [simplified due diligence (SDD)](../blog/simplified-due-diligence-sdd.md), and [enhanced due diligence (EDD)](./enhanced-due-diligence-edd.md) — as the system learns more about the individual. In this way, progressive risk segmentation helps a business balance their fraud prevention and compliance needs against the need to provide a positive user experience.
