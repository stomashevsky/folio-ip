# Secretary of State (SOS) Filing | Definition & FAQs

When a company does business in a state, it’s required to register with state agencies — typically the state’s Secretary of State. The process through which a company files information and documents to register as a business in that state is known as a **Secretary of State (SOS) filing**.

Importantly, a company may be required to register in a state even if it’s headquartered in a different jurisdiction. This is the case if:

-   Any of the company’s employees work in the state
    
-   A significant amount of the company’s revenue originates in the state
    
-   The company has many in-person business meetings in the state
    
-   The company has a physical presence (office, satellite office) in the state
