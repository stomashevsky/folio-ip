# What is VAT Validation?

All European Union member nations impose a value-added tax (VAT) on items sold in the EU. In these countries, businesses are assigned a VAT number, which is similar to the Employer Identification Number (EIN) issued to businesses in the US. **VAT validation** is the process of verifying that a business has a valid VAT number. It can also be used to confirm whether a VAT number is associated with a particular name and address. 

It’s important to note that while more than 160 countries around the world impose a VAT tax and therefore issue VAT numbers, VAT validation typically refers only to countries in the EU.
