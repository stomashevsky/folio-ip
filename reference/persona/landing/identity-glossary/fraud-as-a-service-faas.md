# Fraud as a Service (FaaS) | Definition & FAQs

**Fraud as a Service (FaaS)** refers to situations in which a bad actor or larger fraud ring allows others to hire them to commit fraudulent activity for the purpose of making money or causing harm. The term can also be used when an individual purchases tools, code, or software from a bad actor to carry out fraud themselves. It is, in essence, a third-party business model where the product is the fraud itself.
