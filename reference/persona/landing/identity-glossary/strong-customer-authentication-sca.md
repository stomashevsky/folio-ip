# What is Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)?

Starting on September 14, 2019, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requires that businesses use two independent [authentication](./identity-authentication.md) elements (something a customer knows, has, or is) to verify payments. 3D Secure 2 — the new version of 3D Secure rolling out in 2019 — will be the primary authentication method used to meet SCA requirements for card payments.
