# Social Media Profiling | Definition & FAQs

**Social media profiling**, or **social profiling**, refers to the process of building a non-public profile of an individual using publicly available information from one or more social media platforms. This can include, but is not limited to, information about:

-   Who a person is (their name, address, contact information, date of birth, work and education history, etc.)
    
-   Who a person knows (their friends, family members, neighbors, coworkers, etc.)
    
-   A person’s routine (their work or class schedule, when they attend certain events or activities)
    
-   A person’s interests (favorite movies, music, books, etc.)
    
-   A person’s appearance (through photos and videos)
    

These profiles can then be used for a variety of purposes, including both fraud and fraud prevention.
