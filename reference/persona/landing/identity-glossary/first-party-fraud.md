# First-Party Fraud | Definition & Common Questions

**First-party fraud** refers to instances where a bad actor misrepresents themselves — providing false information about their identity or financial situation, for example — in order to realize some kind of gain. In cases of first-party fraud, the primary victim could be a financial institution or business the bad actor is lying to, or even an individual. This differs from second- and third-party fraud in that it doesn’t involve the bad actor taking advantage of another person’s information.
