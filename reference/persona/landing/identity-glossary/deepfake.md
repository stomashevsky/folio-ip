# What are Deepfakes: Definition and FAQs

A [**deepfake**](../blog/what-are-deepfakes.md) is any image, video, or audio that shows a person doing something they never actually did. The name is a portmanteau of the word “deep learning,” which is the machine-learning technique used to generate the images and the word “fake.” Deepfakes are also broadly called **synthetic media**. 

Fraudsters use deepfakes to bypass verification and authentication systems so they can:

-   Create fake accounts
    
-   Access accounts that aren’t theirs 
    
-   Access sensitive data (personal, financial, health, etc.)
    
-   Complete or authorize fraudulent transactions
    
-   Create a [synthetic ID](./synthetic-id.md)
    
-   and more
