# Compliance as a Service (CaaS) | Definition & FAQs

**Compliance as a Service (CaaS)** is a business model in which one business hires another business to design, implement, consult on, and/or manage their compliance needs.

The CaaS business model makes it possible for a business to become and remain compliant with the regulations affecting them without needing to build and oversee their own in-house compliance solutions.
