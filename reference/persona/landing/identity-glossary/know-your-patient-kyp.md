# Know Your Patient: Definition and FAQs

[**Know Your Patient (KYP)**](../blog/know-your-patient-kyp-how-to-mitigate-healthcare-fraud.md) refers to various processes that a healthcare company uses to verify and reverify a patient’s identity. 

KYP verification typically involves the collection of a patient’s name, date of birth, Social Security number, and health insurance information during patient onboarding. This information is then verified via some combination of [document verification](../blog/document-verification-understanding-the-whole-process.md), [database verification](../blog/what-are-issuing-database-verifications.md), [government ID verification](../blog/what-is-government-id-verification.md), [selfie verification](../blog/what-is-selfie-identity-verification-and-how-does-it-work.md), or other methods. The patient’s identity is then reverified through similar means during future interactions. 

KYP plays an important role in preventing health insurance fraud, Medicare/Medicaid fraud, and medical identity theft. It’s also instrumental in protecting sensitive patient data and ensuring that your company remains HIPAA compliant.
