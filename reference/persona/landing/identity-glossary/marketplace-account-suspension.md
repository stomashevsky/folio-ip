# Marketplace Account Suspension Definition & FAQs

**Marketplace account suspension** is exactly what it sounds like: a situation in which a user’s account with an online marketplace is suspended, typically because the account was used to engage in fraud or other prohibited activities. Account suspension is a means for the online marketplace to discipline users who have broken the platform’s rules for maintaining trust and safety, while also protecting other users who may have been impacted by the suspended account’s behavior. 

Once the account has been suspended, the user will typically be unable to access it or, if access is still permitted, the user will be unable to leverage its functions. For buyers, this may include completing purchases, leaving reviews, and communicating with sellers. For sellers, this may include listing products or services, receiving payments, completing sales, and communicating with buyers.
