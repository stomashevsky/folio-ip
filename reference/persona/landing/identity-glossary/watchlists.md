# What is a Watchlist? | Definition & FAQs | Persona Glossary

Watchlists are lists of people and entities (such as organizations, states, and countries) companies may want to monitor and screen against, such as Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [sanctions](./sanctions.md) lists, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) lists, [Politically Exposed Person (PEP)](../blog/what-is-a-politically-exposed-person-pep.md) lists, and more. Monitoring these watchlists can help businesses enrich their understanding of users, deter, detect, and deny fraud, and perform ongoing KYC/AML monitoring without going through additional integration or procurement.
