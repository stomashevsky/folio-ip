# Second-Party Fraud | Definition & Common Questions

**Second-party fraud** refers to instances where an individual gives their credentials, identity information, or other sensitive data to another person so that the second person can engage in fraud. It is essentially permission to engage in “light identity theft.” This is often done in exchange for payment; other times it stems from a desire to help a friend or family member in financial need.
