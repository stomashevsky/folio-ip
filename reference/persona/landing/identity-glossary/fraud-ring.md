# Fraud Ring | Definition & Common Questions

A **fraud ring** is a group consisting of multiple bad actors who work together to perpetrate fraud, such as money laundering, identity theft, or marketplace fraud. Fraud rings can be small or large, consisting of as few as two or three bad actors, or spanning into the dozens or even hundreds. Often, the members of a fraud ring will share resources (for example, identity information needed to skirt [identity verification](./identity-verification-idv.md) measures) and work in tandem to realize their goals.
