# Know Your Employee | Definition & FAQs

**Know Your Employee (KYE)** refers to the steps a business takes to verify an employee’s identity, background, and credentials in order to assess the individual’s fraud risk to the workplace. It often occurs just prior to an employment offer being made or immediately after an offer has been accepted — but typically prior to onboarding. It should also occur periodically over the course of an employee’s employment since relevant details could change.
