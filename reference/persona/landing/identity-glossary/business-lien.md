# Business Lien | Definition & FAQs | Persona Identity Glossary

A **business lien**, also called a **corporate lien**, is a legal claim against a company’s assets — typically financial assets, real estate, vehicles, or other equipment — filed by an entity to which the company owes money. Liens show that the filing entity has an interest in these assets and that the assets can potentially be seized and sold to pay back the debt. 

Liens are often filed by:

-   Lenders who are owed repayment on a business loan
    
-   Governments (federal, state, local) for unpaid income and property taxes
    
-   Contractors who are owed payment for services provided
