# Top US food delivery service deterred fraud in its 3-sided marketplace by verifying couriers with Persona

Instead of building its own identity verification solution, the delivery service used Persona's ID verification solution to prevent individuals from using false information to sign up as a courier, protecting both buyers and merchants without impacting courier growth or conversion.

## Problem: To prevent fraud and ensure safety on the platform, the delivery service needed to verify that couriers were signing up using their real identities — without impeding overall growth.

The business coordinates transactions among buyers, couriers, and merchants in a complex three-sided marketplace. As its marketplace grew, it increasingly prioritized the safeguarding of participants on all sides.

In the case of couriers, ensuring one valid identity for every courier on the platform was important for handling cases of fleet agreement violations and protecting customers and merchant partners.

At the same time, it operates in a competitive market where increasing the number of couriers is critical for growth. As such, it needed an [identity verification solution](../index.md) that would prevent someone from using false information to sign up as a courier without impeding the growth of courier signups overall.

## Solution: Persona’s identity verification provided both a robust and low-friction identity verification experience

> Persona has a straightforward design and UI to implement identity verification - a plug and play option with lightweight friction. Rather than building for all of this ourselves, it made sense for us to use a vendor that we trust.

The delivery service evaluated several identity verification solutions before ultimately partnering with Persona. It chose Persona for the following reasons:

### 1\. Preventing bad actors from signing up with false information

‍With Persona, the company configured a custom set of [verifications](../product/verifications.md) to meet its needs, with checks and balances that make it particularly challenging to falsify one’s identity.

### 2\. Optimizing for a fast, low-friction courier experience

‍It was critical to the company that any solution it implemented did not negatively impact the onboarding of new couriers. Persona’s platform allowed new couriers to complete their onboarding quickly and painlessly with instantaneous results.

### 3\. Integrating the solution easily

[‍Persona's API](../../docs/reference/introduction.md) is simple and easy to integrate, which allowed the delivery service to showcase its brand with a streamlined UI. By integrating with Persona instead of building its own identity verification solution, it freed up valuable resources to direct toward other critical business projects.

## Results: With Persona, the delivery service implemented identity verification in courier onboarding without sacrificing conversion rates and courier growth.

Since implementing Persona it:

-   Improved the protection of buyers and merchants on its platform by ensuring that new couriers are signing up with their real identities.
    
-   Implemented a robust identity verification process without impacting courier growth or conversion.
