# Persona Identities Inc. (“Persona” or “we”) SMS for Identity Verification Terms

1.  Persona provides identity verification services to its business customers where they utilize Persona to verify the identity of their users (“you”). If you opt in we may send an SMS to you (e.g., to switch a device you are using or as part of a two factor verification).
    
2.  You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Just text "STOP" to the phone number. After you send the SMS message "STOP" to us, we will send you an SMS message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join again, just sign up as you did the first time and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.
    
3.  If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly [here](https://help.withpersona.com/articles/2M9q1MBYN2SL19JKWiGOuX/).
    
4.  Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
