Customer grants Persona a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to collect, use, modify and process Customer Data to provide the Persona Service and related services (including for customer support), and for quality assurance and fraud prevention. The foregoing does not prevent Persona from generating Aggregated Anonymous Data in accordance with applicable law.
    
3.  **California Consumer Privacy Act**. The parties’ rights and obligations under the California Consumer Privacy Act are set forth in the Persona CCPA Addendum available at [https://withpersona.com/ccpa-addendum](../ccpa-addendum.md) (the “**CCPA Addendum**”).

Persona will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all Helpdesk tickets within one (1) business day. Persona may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Customer with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases but will have no obligation to provide support or maintenance for these items.  
    
2.  **Other Services.** Persona may also provide onboarding, deployment and other services under this Agreement. The scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be specified in an Order Form, statement of work or other document referencing this Agreement. Customer may use anything delivered as part of these additional services internally during its Term to support its authorized use of the Persona Service, subject to the restrictions above applicable to the Persona Service itself.  Persona’s ability to deliver services will depend on Customer’s reasonable and timely cooperation, and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Customer needed to deliver the services.  For clarity, Customer retains ownership of any Confidential Information it provides to Persona. 
    

# 6\. Fees and payment

1.  **Fees.** Customer agrees to pay all fees in the currency and payment period specified in the applicable Order Form.

2.  **Credit Card Payment Terms.** If Customer elects to pay via credit card, then Customer is solely responsible for either (a) enabling auto-recharge on Customer’s payment instrument or (b) ensuring that Customer’s payment instrument has a sufficient positive balance to cover all fees due.

If Customer is overdue on any payment of undisputed fees and fails to pay within ten (10) business days of a written notice, then Persona may assess, and Customer agrees to pay, a late fee of either 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by applicable law, whichever is less.
    
4.  **Disputes.** Customer must notify Persona in writing of any good-faith invoice dispute within twenty (20) days of the applicable invoice date and reasonably cooperate with Persona in resolving any dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute within ten (10) days of Customer’s notice, each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any provision in this Agreement that would limit seeking these remedies on account of a payment dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full in accordance with this Section.

3.  **Suspension of Service.** Persona may suspend Customer’s access to the Persona Service(s) if Customer’s account is overdue and Customer fails to pay amounts due within ten (10) days of notice by Persona, subject to Section 6.4 (Disputes). Persona may also suspend Customer’s access to the Persona Service(s) if it determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Persona Service.
    
4.  **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Order Form, if the other party: (i) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay undisputed fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (ii) ceases operation without a successor; or (iii) if permitted by applicable law, seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any of these proceedings are instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
    
5.  **Effect of Termination.** Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or an Order Form, Customer’s rights to the Persona Service terminate and it must promptly: (a) stop using the applicable Persona Service(s) (including any related Persona Technology); (b) stop distributing any Persona Code installed on its Customer Properties; and (c) delete (or, at Persona’s request, return) any and all copies of the Persona Code, any Persona documentation, passwords or access codes, and any other Persona Confidential Information in Customer’s possession, custody, or control.  If Persona terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 7.4 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Customer. If Customer terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 7.4 (Termination for Cause), Customer will receive a refund of any fees it has pre-paid for the terminated portion of the applicable Term. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.
    
6.  **Survival.** The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 2 (Account Registration and Use); 3.3 (General Restrictions); 3.4 (Fair Credit Reporting Act) 3.6 (Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions); 4.2 (Rights in Customer Data); 6 (Fees and Payment); 7 (Term and Termination); 8 (Confidential Information); 9 (Persona Technology); 10 (Disclaimers); 11 (Indemnification); 12 (Limitations of Liability); and 13 (General).
    

# 8\. Confidential information

1.  **Confidentiality Obligation.** Each party (as the receiving party) must: (i) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties except as permitted by this Agreement; and (ii) only use the other party’s Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its, and its Affiliates’, employees, agents or contractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Persona, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.4), provided that the party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 8 and that these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.
    
2.  **Exclusions.** These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (i) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was known by the receiving party before it received the Confidential Information; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.
    
3.  **Remedies.** The parties acknowledge that disclosing Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so on breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.
    

# 9\. Persona technology

1.  **Ownership and Updates.** This is a term-limited  agreement for access to and use of the Persona Service. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Persona Service and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Customer under this Agreement. Persona (or its suppliers) retain all rights, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Persona Technology, which is deemed Persona’s Confidential Information, and reserves all rights not specifically granted in this Agreement. Other than the Persona Code, the Persona Service is offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Persona Service, that Persona may collect learnings, logs, and data regarding the performance and use of the Persona Service, and that Persona may make updates, bug fixes, modifications or improvements to the Persona Service from time-to-time.
    
2.  **Feedback.** If Customer elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas or other feedback or related materials to Persona (collectively, “Feedback”), Customer hereby grants Persona a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any Feedback in any format and in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise, however Persona will not identify Customer as the source of the Feedback. Nothing in this Agreement limits Persona’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

# 11\. Indemnification

‍Customer agrees to defend Persona from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from Customer Properties (including services or products provided through the Customer Properties), or a breach or alleged breach of Section 3.4 or 3.5. Customer will indemnify and hold Persona harmless from and against any damages and costs awarded against Persona or agreed in settlement by Customer (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that result from these third-party claims. Customer must not settle any claim without Persona’s prior written consent if the settlement would require Persona to admit fault, pay amounts that Customer must pay under this Agreement, or take or refrain from taking any action.
