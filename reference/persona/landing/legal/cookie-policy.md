# Cookie Policy

## Introduction

Persona uses cookies and similar technologies on our website (the "Site") and the Persona service (the "Service") to operate and administer the Site and Service, gather usage and performance data and deliver targeted advertising to you. This is described in more detail below.

This Cookie Policy (“Cookie Policy”) provides information about how and when we use cookies and similar technologies and the choices that you have. We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Data or information that becomes Personal Data if we combine it with other information. In such cases, our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.

## What are cookies and similar technologies?

**Cookies.** A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. Cookies can help a website like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage behavior. They also allow us to share activity on our website with third party partners, including advertising partners.  For more details on cookies and similar technologies please visit [All About Cookies.](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

Cookies can be stored on your device for different periods of time. “Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the party placing it) and help recognize your device when you open your browser and browse the site again. For example, if you log in to the Service, we use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.

Cookies set by Persona on the Site and Service are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than Persona are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies typically enable certain third party features or functionality to be provided on or through websites or services (such as, advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize an individual's device both when they visit the website or use the service in question and also when they visit certain other websites.

**Web beacons / pixels.** Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message. We also use pixel tags, from the third parties described in the "Analytics / Pixels" section below, to get information about your usage of the Site, determine whether you interacted with email or other communications, and to serve advertising to you.

**Fingerprinting.** Fingerprinting involves combining a set of features or characteristics from a device or browser in order to uniquely identify you. We may use fingerprinting on the Service for fraud detection purposes.

**Caching and local storage.** We also use caching and local storage in your browser for account security and fraud prevention purposes, for example, to allow us to detect if you are using a new device or an abnormal number of new devices to sign into the Service.

## What cookies do we use and why?

We use cookies and similar technologies on our Site and Service as described below:

## Strictly Necessary Cookies

Strictly necessary cookies are used to provide critical features of the Service, such as the ability to log-in and access secure areas. These cookies are essential for using the Service and without these cookies basic functionalities would not work. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Service to you, you may not be able to block them.

Here is a list of the cookies we use on the Service and why:

## Performance and Functionality Cookies

Performance and functionality cookies are used to enhance the Service (such as collecting performance and error data, enabling customer support for users by offering live support chat). We also use cookies to save user’s registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. These cookies are not essential for using the Service. However, without these cookies, performance of the Service may be slowed or degraded.

You can block or delete these cookies by changing the browser settings as explained under the “Your Choices” section below.

## Analytics Cookies/Pixels

Analytics Cookies/Pixels are used to recognize and count the number of Site visitors and see how visitors move around the Site (including number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page) and Service. This helps us to improve the way our Site works, for example by making sure you can easily find what you need, and to monitor the performance of our Service in order to improve it. We also use tools on certain pages of our Services to record and analyze your interaction with our services, including tools to track cursor movements and clicks, and record your screen while you’re on our website, to help us improve your experience.
