This Persona Identities, Inc. (“Persona,” “we”, “us”, or “our”) Privacy Policy is divided into two parts. The first applies to individuals using the Persona Service to verify their identities as part of our Service offered to our business customers. The second applies to our business customers (“Customers”) and visitors to our website (the “Site”). If you are verifying your identity as a LinkedIn member or are using our Reusable Personas feature, please see this [privacy policy](../idv-privacy-policy.md).

California Customers and visitors to our Site can find specific disclosures, including “Notice at Collection” details, by clicking [here](./privacy-policy.md#california-privacy-rights).

‍

## Privacy Policy applicable to individuals verifying their identity through the Persona Service

Persona’s Customers offer the Persona service (the “Service”) to securely verify the identity of individuals (“you”). Persona processes Personal Data of individuals at the direction of its Customers. This section of the Privacy Policy explains how Persona, under the direction of its Customers, processes Personal Data in order to provide the Service for its Customers. Personal Data provided to Persona by Customers, and Personal Data provided to Customers from Persona, is subject to the Customers’ Privacy Policy. This section explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect through the Service, how we use and share that data, and how individuals can exercise choices regarding their Personal Data.

### How We Collect and Use Personal Data to Provide the Service

This section describes the Personal Data we collect and how we use it in order to provide the Service to our Customers. Personal Data means information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

You provide Personal Data to us at the direction of our Customers so that our Customer may verify your identity and/or prevent fraud. In the course of performing the Service, we may also obtain Personal Data from other sources such as third party databases, government records, and other publicly available sources. The Personal Data we collect varies based on what you provide, what the Customer has directed us to analyze, and what Personal Data is available from third parties.   

You may directly provide:

-   **Name and contact information**, including name, email address, address, and phone number; 
    
-   **Demographic data**, including birthdate and age; 
    
-   **Files you upload,** such as tax forms and utility bills;
    
-   **Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers**, such as driver's license and Social Security Number; and
    
-   **Audio, Video, and Photos of you,** namely from the selfie or video you provide and from your government identification document.
    

Our Services may also collect the following from you, our Customer, or third parties: 

-   **Current and previous name and contact information**, including name, email address, address, and phone number; 
    
-   **Demographic data**, including birthdate and age, gender, marital status, and similar demographic details; 
    
-   **Government documents, barcodes, and identifiers**, such as drivers license and Social Security Numbers;
    
-   **Device information**, including IP address, device type, your device’s operating system, browser, cookie and device identifiers, and other software including type, version, language, settings, and configuration;
    
-   **Account information**, such as details about your account with our Customer or other third parties;
    
-   **Publicly available data**, including data from governmental public records, the public internet and social media; 
    
-   **Geolocation data** as we may infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP address; 
    
-   **Biometric Data**, only with your express consent, including a scan of your facial geometry based on the photos or video you provide. For more information about Biometric Data, see the Facial Scan and Biometrics Information section below.
    

Based on the Personal Data we collect from you and other sources, we infer information about you for identity verification and fraud prevention purposes.  For example, we may use certain information about you including your IP address and home address to inform our verification process. 

Some data that we collect automatically is collected through cookies and similar technologies.  See our  Cookies section below to learn more. 

We use Personal Data to provide our Customers with the Service so they can verify the identity of individuals and prevent fraud. This processing is necessary to perform our contract with our Customers. As part of providing the Service, we may use non-sensitive data to improve and test our fraud prevention Services.  

## Notice for Individuals Verifying their Age

For age assurance use cases, Persona's default setting is to automatically delete personal data as soon as processing is complete and an outcome has been determined. However, Persona's business customers may choose to retain certain data for longer periods as necessary to detect, investigate, or prevent suspicious or fraudulent activity.

When you use Persona's Age Assurance, Persona acts as a service provider (or data processor) on behalf of the business customer requesting verification. This means the Persona customer is the data controller responsible for determining how your personal information is processed. You should contact that business directly with any questions about how your data is used, retained, or deleted.

Persona does not sell or share personal data collected for age assurance with third parties. Persona also does not use such data for marketing or for any purpose other than providing the verification service. As part of providing the Service, we may use non-sensitive data to improve and test our fraud prevention Services.  

### **Wireless Operator Authorization** 

To assist our customers  in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to us or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. See this Privacy Policy for how we treat your data.

### How We Disclose Personal Data

We may engage third parties to assist us in providing the Services, in which case we may disclose Personal Data to them. We may also disclose Personal Data to service providers, including hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers; email communication and SMS software providers; and identity verification services, mobile device operators, background check providers, public and private records database providers, consumer reporting services, and fraud and identity management providers. For example, we may disclose your name and address to a third party database provider in order to request information they may have about you. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process or store Personal Data while performing their duties to us. We may also disclose Personal Data when required to do so by law.

### Facial Scan and Biometrics Information

This section describes how Persona treats scans of facial geometry extracted from photos. 

Persona, acting as a service provider to the Customer:

-   compares the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document that you upload to the data from a scan of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload, in order to help verify your identity (“Verification”); and
    
-   may also use your information, including data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, to detect and prevent fraud (“Fraud Prevention”).
    

The images obtained from government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the government identification document and photos of your face that you upload, are collected, used and stored directly by Persona on behalf of Customer as Customer’s service provider through Customer’s website or app that you accessed.  Depending on our relationship with the Customer, the Customer may upload your government identification document and photos of your face directly to us.

Persona securely stores all photos of identity documents that you upload, photos of your face that you upload, and data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in an encrypted format. Persona’s [third-party vendors](../customer-documents/subprocessors.md) may have access to the data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload to provide some or all of the analysis, to store the data, to maintain backup copies, and to service the systems on which such data is stored. Persona will permanently destroy data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload upon completion of Verification or within three years of your last interaction with Persona, consistent with the Customer’s instructions unless Persona is otherwise required by law or legal process to retain the data.      

Persona uses the reasonable standards of care within its industry to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which it stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and sensitive information. Persona will not sell, lease, trade, or, other than to provide the Verification and Fraud Prevention services to Customer described in this policy, otherwise benefit from data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload. Other than as set forth herein, Persona will not disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate data from scans of facial geometry extracted from the photos of your face that you upload unless doing so: 

-   Completes a Customer transaction requested and authorized by you or your legally authorized representative; 
    
-   Is required by state or federal law, or municipal ordinance; 
    
-   Is required pursuant to a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or 
    
-   Is expressly consented to by you.
    

### Choices Regarding Personal Data

Persona is the data processor for the processing of Personal Data on behalf of its Customers. If you are an individual whose identity has been verified through Persona, please contact the appropriate Customer to exercise any rights that you may have under applicable law. If you have further concerns or questions regarding the processing of your Personal Data, please fill out this [form](../dsar.md) or email [privacy@withpersona.com](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com).

### **Class Action Waiver - US Residents Only**

YOU (IF YOUR ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES) AND PERSONA IDENTITIES, INC., INCLUDING ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS (“COMPANY”) AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR COMPANY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND COMPANY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, COMPANY, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING. THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER COVERS ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY AND ALSO INCLUDES ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, BOARD MEMBER, AGENT, EMPLOYEE, VENDOR, AFFILIATE, OR CLIENT OF COMPANY, IF COMPANY COULD BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUCH DISPUTE.

THE TERM “DISPUTE” SHALL BE INTERPRETED AS BROADLY AS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW AND SHALL APPLY TO ALL PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE LEGAL DISPUTES AND LEGAL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY THAT ARE NOW IN EXISTENCE OR THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LEGAL DISPUTES OR LEGAL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, THE COLLECTION OF FACIAL SCANS OR BIOMETRIC INFORMATION, THE PRIVACY POLICY OR COMPANY’S SERVICES; YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY; YOUR USE OF ANY COMPANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE; COMPANY’S CONDUCT; AND ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDINANCE APPLICABLE TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY AS TO WHICH A COURT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY LAW TO GRANT RELIEF IF THE CLAIM WERE SUCCESSFUL (“DISPUTE” OR “DISPUTES”).

### How we disclose Personal Data

We disclose Personal Data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we disclose each of the categories of Personal Data described above, with the types of third parties described below, for the following business purposes:

-   **Public information.** You may select options available through our services to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data.

Third party analytics and advertising companies also collect Personal Data through our website and apps including identifiers and device information (such as cookie IDs, device IDs, and IP address), geolocation data, usage data, and inferences based on and associated with that data, as described in our Cookie Policy. These third party vendors may combine this data across multiple sites to improve analytics for their own purpose and others.

Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

Other third-party analytics and advertising providers we use on our websites are described in our [Cookie Policy](./cookie-policy.md).

Some of the data disclosures to these third parties may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Data as defined under the laws of California and other U.S. states.  Please see the [Choice and Control](#choice-and-control-of-personal-data) and [California Privacy Rights](#california-privacy-rights) sections for more details.

### Data Retention

We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and our legal or contractual obligations.

### Choice and Control of Personal Data

We provide a variety of ways for you to control the personal data we hold about you, including choices about how we use that data. In some jurisdictions, these controls and choices may be enforceable as rights under applicable law.Access, portability, correction, and deletion. _If you wish to access, correct, or delete Personal Data about you that we hold, you may use this_ [_form_](../dsar.md) _or email_ [_privacy@withpersona.com_](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com) _to make your request._

**Communications preferences.** You can choose whether to receive promotional communications from us by email, and telephone. If you receive promotional email from us and would like to stop, you can do so by following the directions in that message or by contacting us as described in the [Contact Us](#contact-us) section below. If you receive a sales call from us, you can ask to be placed on our do-not-call list. These choices do not apply to certain informational communications including surveys and mandatory service communications.

**Choices for Cookies and Similar Technologies.** See our [Cookie Policy](./cookie-policy.md) for choices about cookies and other analytics and advertising controls.

**Data sales and targeted advertising.** Some privacy laws define “sale” broadly to include some the disclosures described in the [How we Disclose Personal Data](#how-we-disclose-personal-data) section above. To opt-out from such data “sales” or targeted advertising, click on “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” on the footer of our website.

Except for the automated controls described above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights or these choices, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline requests in certain cases. For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal or business obligation that requires retention or use of the Personal Data. Further, we may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the Personal Data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal as described in the [Contact Us](#contact-us) section below.

### **European, UK, Swiss Data Protection Rights**

If the processing of Personal Data about you is subject to European Union, United Kingdom, and/or Swiss data protection laws, you have certain rights with respect to that data:

-   You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, Personal Data;  
    
-   If any automated processing of Personal Data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the Personal Data in a usable and portable format;
    
-   If the processing of Personal Data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing;  
    
-   You can object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of Personal Data under certain circumstances; and

We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing Personal Data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.

### California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident and the processing of Personal Data about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), you have certain rights with respect to that information.

**Notice at Collection.** At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices,  including the [categories](#personal-data-collected-from-customers-and-site-visitors) of Personal Data, the [purposes](#how-we-use-personal-data) for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is [sold or shared](#how-we-disclose-personal-data), and how long such information is [retained](#data-retention). You can find those details in this policy by clicking on the above links.

**Right to Know.** You have a right to request that we disclose to you the Personal Data we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such Personal Data. Note that we have provided much of this information in this privacy policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at [privacy@withpersona.com](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com).

**Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.** You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Data and that we delete Personal Data under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, email us at [privacy@withpersona.com](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com).

**Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.** You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of Personal Data as those terms are defined by the CCPA.

The CCPA/CPRA requires us to describe the categories of Personal Data we sell and/or share to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales or sharing.  The CCPA/CPRA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions, such as  disclosing Personal Data to third parties for our own advertising purposes. We let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses and cookie IDs along with associated device and usage data when you access our website, but we do not “sell” or “share” any other types of Personal Data.

If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” or “share” Personal Data relating to your visits to our websites for advertising purposes, you can make your request by clicking on [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](#do-not-sell-link) page, using a Global Privacy Control, or emailing us at [privacy@withpersona.com](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com). If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such Personal Data in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some Personal Data to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” Personal Data or stop all interest-based advertising.

We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.

**Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.** You have a right to limit our use of sensitive Personal Data for any purposes other than to provide the services or goods you request or as otherwise permitted by law. Note that we do not use Sensitive Personal Data for any such additional purposes.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA/CPRA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of Personal Data will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account. For some types of Personal Data we may have, there may be no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity as the person to whom that data relates.

Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA/CPRA.

Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided Personal Data to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Data to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Please be aware that we do not disclose Personal Data to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.

California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing [privacy@withpersona.com](mailto:privacy@withpersona.com). Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated e-mail address.

We take steps designed to ensure that Personal Data is processed and protected as described in this policy wherever the data is located.

**Location of Processing European Personal Data.** We transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.
