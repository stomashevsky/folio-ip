# Environments

There are two types of environments for the Persona flow: sandbox and production.

## Sandbox

Sandbox mode is provided so that you can test your integration without incurring any usage charges. **Real verifications are not performed within sandbox mode.**

A toggle is provided that allows you to force passes or force fails so that you can view and test all the possible states for your integration. Within your dashboard, sample data will be shown.

If you’d like to test information extraction and our verification technology, please [contact us](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us).

## Production

Once you are confident with your integration, [contact us](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us) to discuss pricing and enable a production environment for your organization. Verifications within production environments will be counted towards your overall usage charge.
