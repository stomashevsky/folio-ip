# Subdomains

Change the subdomain of your hosted flow URL in the [Domain Manager](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/manage-domain) of your Dashboard.

Once set, you can add the subdomain to your hosted flow URLs. The one time link(s) will also use it. `https://your-subdomain.withpersona.com/verify?template-id=<your template ID starting with itmpl_>`

An instance of Persona only allows for one unique subdomain.
