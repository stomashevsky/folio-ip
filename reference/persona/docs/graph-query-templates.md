# Graph Query Templates

Graph query templates house the configuration for a single type of graph query. They can be automated or run ad-hoc with different parameters. To get started, find or create the graph templates you want to use in your organization’s [dashboard on the graph templates page](https://withpersona.com/dashboard/graph-query-templates).

## Platform Interoperability

By using Graph Query Templates, you can use them in:

-   [Accounts](./accounts.md) page Graph card
    
    -   Analyze the entities the given Account has relationships with to determine its risk
    -   Compare against historical snapshots to see how the relationships have changed
-   [Cases](./api-reference/cases.md) page Graph module
    
    -   Analyze the entities the given Case object has relationships with to determine its risk
    -   Compare against historical snapshots to see how the relationships have changed
-   [API calls](./running-graph-queries.md)
    
    -   Use all the rich data Persona has in Graph to inform decision making at critical points in your flow
-   [Workflows conditionals](./api-reference/workflows.md)
    
    -   Create automated rules and decisioning based on Graph data within any branch of your workflows
