# MiniApp Integration

MiniApp is a new integration method from Persona that leverages [App Clips](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/) on iOS. MiniApp enables you to verify users natively with no app installation or mobile development required. It is hosted by Persona but its branding and theming is fully customizable. MiniApp enables you to verify individuals with native iOS performance and security that browsers are simply not capable of.

All you need to do is send a URL or QR code to your user to get started.
