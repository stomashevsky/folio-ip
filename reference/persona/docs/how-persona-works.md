# Inquiries Overview

Your customer’s journey is built using collection, verification, and decisioning. Configure it all in one place, and easily bring it to any platform.

[Dynamic Flow](https://withpersona.com/product/dynamic-flow) lets you configure the screens, verifications, decisioning, and theming to make your customer experience match the feel of your business and provide flexibility to cover multiple use cases.

An inquiry wraps a single journey of your customer through such a flow. Learn more about what an Inquiry is in our [Help Center](https://help.withpersona.com/articles/2BerKqpgNIRG81jX0goCMU/). The flow can be configured and integrated with or without engineering:

-   [Hosted](./hosted-flow.md): send your customer an inquiry with a link.
-   [Embedded](./embedded-flow.md): display an inquiry from your website.
-   [Native Mobile SDKs](./mobile-sdks.md): all the theming despite being native.
