# Inquiries Best Practices

## Use webhooks for the most up-to-date Inquiry status

Persona recommends setting up Webhooks to listen for any changes in Inquiry data over polling or client callbacks.

See [Accessing Inquiry status](./accessing-inquiry-status.md) for more information.

## Using reference IDs

We recommend always providing a reference ID when creating inquiries to make it easier to tie inquiries to individuals in your system.

See [Reference IDs](./reference-ids.md) for more information.

## Prefilling fields

Pre-populating inquiries with information you’ve already collected on your user will help streamline the user experience, reduce dropoff, and provide an extra level of assurance that the user is valid.

See [Prefilling Inquiry Fields](./inquiry-fields.md#prefilling-inquiry-fields) for more information.
