# Accounts

An account acts as a mirror between the individuals in your system and the information in Persona. Accounts enable you to view the entire history of how you have interacted with an individual over time and act as an ongoing representation of that individual in the Persona system. As more information is collected for a individual, more information aggregates to the account. All inquiries, documents and reports are connected back to that account, and therefore to a specific individual.

When new inquiries on your system are created with a new reference ID, Persona can automatically create a new account associated with that reference ID. We recommend using your user ID as your Persona reference ID.

## Continuous Reports

[Reports](./reports.md) can be configured to run in regular intervals against an Account. Please [contact us](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us) to set this up.
