# API Logs

You can view a history of your API requests at [API > API Logs](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/api-logs) in Dashboard. API Logs are kept for a maximum of 2 weeks. These logs include request headers, the request itself, and the response.

The HTTP response header contains the API Log’s request ID in the `Request-Id` header.

```
Request-Id: req_EYK7jcUMwagioHmR1J4peaC2
```

You can also retrieve your API Logs via the [API Logs API](./api-reference/api-logs/list-all-api-logs.md)
