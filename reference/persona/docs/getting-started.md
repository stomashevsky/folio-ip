# Introduction

## Welcome to Persona!

Here you’ll find comprehensive information for integrating with Persona and our API endpoints. We’ve tried to make this documentation user-friendly and example-filled.

If you’re planning to use our API in Production, please refer to the [API Reference](./api-introduction.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the API, and our [Privacy Policy](http://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy) to understand how to handle the data.

The most comprehensive way to integrate Persona is to setup an [Embedded Flow](./embedded-flow.md) for web or integrate with one of our [Mobile SDKs](./mobile-sdks.md), and the fastest way without any code is to setup a [Hosted Flow](./hosted-flow.md). See [Choosing an integration method](./choosing-an-integration-method.md) for details.
