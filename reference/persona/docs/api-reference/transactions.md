# Transactions

[Transactions](../transactions.md) represent significant interactions or events (e.g. user onboarding, loan application journey, etc). They enable flexible modeling via custom field schemas and custom statuses and sit alongside Accounts as foundational objects within Persona. Whereas the Account represents a user or entity, the Transaction captures some event associated with that user/entity.
