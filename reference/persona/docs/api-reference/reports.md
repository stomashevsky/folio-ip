# Reports

A report represents additional information pulled on the verified individual. An inquiry can contain many reports. Each inquiry’s relationships field lists the IDs of all associated reports. The attributes available for any given report depends on its type. Please [contact us](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us) to determine which reports are the best fit for your use case.

Reports are created and processed asynchronously when an inquiry completes. Check for the following statuses to determine whether a report is ready.

| Report Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pending | While the server processes the report, the report is pending. |
| Ready | When the server finishes processing the report, the report is ready. |
