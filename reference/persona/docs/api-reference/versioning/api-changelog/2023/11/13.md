## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Inquiries

-   🌱 **Account creation opt-out on Inquiry creation**: `meta.auto-create-account` on [Create an Inquiry](../../../../inquiries/create-an-inquiry.md) lets you skip creating an Account
-   🌱 **Choose Account Type on Inquiry creation**: `meta.auto-create-account-type-id` parameter on [Create an Inquiry](../../../../inquiries/create-an-inquiry.md) allows setting a custom Account Type.
-   🍃 **New way to set the Account’s reference ID**: `meta.auto-create-account-reference-id` parameter on [Create an Inquiry](../../../../inquiries/create-an-inquiry.md) is the new preferred way to set the reference ID for the Account to look-up/creation (instead of `data.attributes.reference-id`) to allow for reference IDs for different objects going forward.

### Reports

-   🌱 **Set recurring flag**: [Reports](../../../../reports/create-a-report.md) now return `is-continuous` as a boolean field. This will be `true` when a report is able to recur and is currently recurring in its runs. This, in concert with `has-match`, allows end users to understand which matches are from an initial / recurring run.

### Webhooks

-   🌱 **Manage Webhooks via API**: The new [Webhook](../../../../webhooks/list-all-webhooks.md) endpoints enable automatic management.
-   🌱 **Rotate Webhook Secrets**: [Rotate a Webhook Secret](../../../../webhooks/rotate-a-webhook-secret.md) allow for automating secret rotation.
