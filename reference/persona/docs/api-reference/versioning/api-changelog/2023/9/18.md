## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Documents

-   🌱 **ID Designations on Government ID Documents**: ID designations will now be surfaced as a list of strings under the `designations` attribute. An ID designation is akin to a “tag” for an ID indicating that it belongs to a specific category of interest. For example (non-exhaustive): `learners`, `temporary`, `commercial`, `real_id`. Zero or more designations may apply for a given ID.

### Reports

-   🔧 **Consolidate `result.identifiers.status` for Business Lookup Reports**: We have collapsed the `result.identifiers.status` attribute’s values `unknown` and `not_applicable` to just `unknown`. Previously the behavior for when either was returned was inconsistent.

### Fields

-   🌱 **MIME type for File fields**: Added `mime-type` as an attribute for File fields. More than one type of entity can contain this kind of field (e.g. [Inquiries](../../../../../inquiries.md) or [Transactions](../../../../../transactions.md)).
