## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Inquiries

-   🌱 **Short one-time links**: When you [Generate a one-time link](../../../../inquiries/generate-a-one-time-link.md), a short version of the link will now be returned, along with the full link. The short link is returned in the field `meta.one-time-link-short`.

### Accounts

-   🌱 **Account details in `fields`** **object**: [Accounts](../../../../accounts/retrieve-an-account.md) have a new `fields` object that contains details of the Account, such as first name, last name, birthdate, etc. If you have the choice, use `fields` to read details about the Account, instead of `attributes`.

### Reports

-   🍃 **Dismiss a Business Watchlist Report match**: You can now dismiss a Report match for the Business Watchlist Report type. Use the existing [Dismiss a Report](../../../../reports/dismiss-matches.md) API, and pass a Business Watchlist Report ID.
