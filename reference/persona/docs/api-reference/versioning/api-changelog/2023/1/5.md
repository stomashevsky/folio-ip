## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

## API version: v2023-01-05

### Cross-API

-   💥 🔒 **Format and access control of File URLs**: The way file URLs are serialized in all API responses has changed. Each file URL now contains a signed access token, which remains valid for 6 hours after the API request was made. For details, see [File URLs](../../../../../downloading-files.md).

### Graph

_As of 2023-01-05, Graph is in closed beta. To learn more and request early access, see the [the Graph product page](https://withpersona.com/product/graph)._

-   💥 **Format of Graph Query responses**: Graph Query responses will now show computed stats for the query results instead of the raw result output.
