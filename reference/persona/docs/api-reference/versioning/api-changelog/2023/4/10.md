## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Inquiries

-   🍃 **Resumed Inquiry persists locale from previous session**: A [resumed Inquiry](../../../../../resuming-inquiries.md) now loads with the same locale as the previous session (if set). Previously, a resumed Inquiry would load with the locale of the current device.
-   🍃 **One-time links generated only when needed**: The [Generate a one-time link](../../../../inquiries/generate-a-one-time-link.md) API now returns a previously-created but unused, unexpired link if one exists. This change prevents you from creating too many links if you accidentally call this endpoint many times.

### Verifications

-   🌱 **More metadata for Government ID Verification’s Allowed ID check**: The Allowed ID verification check (`id-disallowed-type-detection`) now returns additional `metadata` fields when the check passes or fails: `country-code`, `detected-id-designations`, `disallowed-id-designations`.
    
-   🍃 **New defaults for Selfie Verification**: Going forward, when you create a Selfie Verification, two new defaults are set. These defaults reflect what we find works best for most customers, and these settings remain configurable. The new defaults are:
    
    1.  The Selfie Liveness verification check (`selfie-liveness-detection`) is enabled.
    2.  The Verification requires what we call “strict selfie capture”—a set of standards that mean the selfie must be higher resolution, and the face more centered.
-   🔧 **Enable Verification types in Sandbox**: The following Verification types can now be created in the Sandbox environment:
    
    -   AAMVA
    -   eCBSV Database
    -   Serpro Database
    -   TIN Database
    -   Selfie

### Transactions

-   🌱 **Update Transaction status via API**: You can update the status of a Transaction by setting the new `status` attribute in the `/update` endpoint.
