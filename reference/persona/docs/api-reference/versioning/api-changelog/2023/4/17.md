## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Verifications

-   🌱 **Video URL for Selfie and Government ID Verifications**: If a Selfie Verification or Government ID Verification is completed using a video selfie, the video selfie will be returned in the new `video-url` field in the verification’s `attributes`.
-   🌱 **More metadata for Government ID Verification’s Extraction inconsistency check**: The Extraction inconsistency verification check (`id-extraction-inconsistency-detection`) for Government ID Verification now returns an additional `metadata` field: `check-requirements`. `check-requirements` is an array of objects. Each object represents a check requirement and its result.
-   🍃 **Selfie photo from Government ID Verification can be tested in Sandbox**: In the Sandbox environment, the `selfie-photo-url` field is now set, using the front photo of the Government ID (instead of the actual selfie photo). This change allows you to test changes in Sandbox that depend on `selfie-photo-url`. (For example, you can use the selfie photo from a Government ID Verification as an input to a Selfie Verification.) As background, since Persona does not run real Verifications in Sandbox, we do not detect the face in the photo on a Government ID. In the past, this meant the `selfie-photo-url` field on a Government ID Verification was left empty.
