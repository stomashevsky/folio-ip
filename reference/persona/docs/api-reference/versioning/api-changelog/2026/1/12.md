## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Reports

-   🍃 **Add position topics, start dates, and end dates to Politically Exposed Person Reports**: The `positions` attribute in Politically Exposed Person Reports now exposes position topics as well as the start and end dates indicating the duration each position was held. See the [Retrieve a Report](../../../../reports/retrieve-a-report.md) endpoint for details.

### Events

-   🍃 **Add `context` attribute to Events and Webhook Events**: Events and Webhook Event resources now include a **`context`** [**attribute**](../../../../events/retrieve-an-event.md#response.body.data.attributes.context) that can hold additional information for certain event types. To start, the `account.added-relation` and `account.removed-relation` events will have `relation-schema-key` and `target-account-id` attributes within `context`.
