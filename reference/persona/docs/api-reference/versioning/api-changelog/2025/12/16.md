## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Accounts

-   🌱 **Add endpoint to search Accounts**: You can now use complex queries to search for Accounts via [the search endpoint](../../../../accounts/search-accounts.md). Using search is a faster alternative to using the [list all Accounts endpoint](../../../../accounts/list-all-accounts.md). It is not appropriate for read-after-write flows because the data is not immediately available to search.

### Cases

-   🌱 **Add endpoint to search Cases**: You can now use complex queries to search for Cases via [the search endpoint](../../../../cases/search-cases.md). Using search is a faster alternative to using the [list all Cases endpoint](../../../../cases/list-all-cases.md). It is not appropriate for read-after-write flows because the data is not immediately available to search.

### Reports

-   🌱 **Add endpoint to retrieve Report history**: You can now retrieve the full audit history of the report, including the scheduled and ad-hoc report runs + report actions from [a dedicated endpoint](../../../../reports/list-report-history.md).
