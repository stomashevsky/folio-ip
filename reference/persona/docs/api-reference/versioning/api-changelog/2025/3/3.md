## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Verifications

-   🍃 **New defaults for Government ID Verification Template**: Going forward, when you create a Government ID Verification, six new verification checks are enabled and required: `id_age_comparison`, `id_age_comparison`, `id_color_inconsistency_detection`, `id_double_side_detection`, `id_fabrication_detection`, `id_tamper_detection`, `id_unprocessable_submission_detection`. These defaults reflect what we find works best for most customers. These settings remain configurable.
-   🍃 **New defaults for Selfie Verification Template**: Going forward, when you create a Selfie Verification, two new verification checks are enabled and required: `selfie_face_covering_detection`, `selfie_suspicious_entity_detection`. These defaults reflect what we find works best for most customers. These settings remain configurable.
