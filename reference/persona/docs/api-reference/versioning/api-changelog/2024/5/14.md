## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Document Verifications

-   🍃 **Add `document-type` Document Verifications**: Document Verifications now include a `document-type` attribute. `document-type` refers to the classification of the submitted document, such as `bank_statement` or `credit_card_statement`.

### Inquiries

-   🍃 **Asynchronous redaction of related resources**: Previously, the [Inquiry redaction API](../../../../inquiries/redact-an-inquiry.md) would redact the Inquiry as well as any related resources (Accounts, Verifications, etc.) synchronously. Now it will redact the Inquiry synchronously and redact any related resources asynchronously. The `inquiry.redacted` event will only be emitted after all objects are redacted. This should improve performance.
