## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Webhooks

-   🌱 **Fully custom HTTP headers**: You can now [configure Webhooks](../../../../../webhook-custom-http-headers.md) to send with fully custom HTTP headers. Previously, you could only choose custom header keys from a pre-set list. This feature is only enabled for enterprise customers.
-   🍃 **Support HTTP 204 responses**: Webhook events will now advance from `pending` to `completed` when your server returns an HTTP 204 status.

### Accounts & Transactions

-   🍃 **Asynchronous redaction of related resources**: Previously, the [Account](../../../../accounts/redact-an-account.md) and [Transaction](../../../../transactions/redact-a-transaction.md) redaction APIs would redact the primary object (Account or Transaction) as well as any related resources (Inquiries, Verifications, etc.) synchronously. Now these APIs will redact the primary object synchronously and redact any related resources asynchronously. The `account.redacted` and `transaction.redacted` events will only be emitted after all objects are redacted. This should improve performance.
