## About

Below is a log of changes to the Persona API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

-   **Breaking changes = new API version**: When we make any backwards-incompatible changes, we release a new version of the API. In addition to being assigned a new API version, these changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. You’re in charge of when you get breaking changes—you get them when you upgrade your API version. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
-   **Ongoing changes**: Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible, and are added on an ongoing basis. You don’t need to update your API version to get these updates.

##### SDK changelogs

Each Persona SDK has a separate changelog: [Android SDK](../../../../../android-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [iOS SDK](../../../../../ios-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [React Native SDK](../../../../../react-native-sdk-v2-changelog.md), [Javascript SDK](../../../../../embedded-flow-changelog.md), [Inlined React SDK](../../../../../inlined-react-changelog.md), [Inlined Vue SDK](../../../../../inlined-vue-changelog.md)

### Inquiries

-   🍃 **Support Inquiry Creation with Custom Expiration Interval Parameters**: The Inquiry Creation Endpoint now allows overriding the template’s expiration settings with the following attributes. These parameters specify the time intervals (in seconds) after which an Inquiry will expire, making the flow inaccessible.
    
    -   `expiration_after_create_interval_seconds`: From Inquiry Creation
    -   `expiration_after_start_interval_seconds`: From Inquiry Start
    -   `expiration_after_resume_interval_seconds`: From Inquiry Resume
    -   `one_time_link_expiration_seconds`: Device Handoff Link
