# Founders meetup in SF

![meetup pic AI](../images/A_vibrant_and_dynamic_photo_of_a_diverse_group_o_73e1bd5d78fd.jpg)

Founders, founders-to-be, visionaries, investors - let's connect!

The event will be held at Persona's HQ on Sacramento st (Financial District) and I'll organize to have some pizzas and drinks for us!

If you're interested in being a sponsor to help cover the food/drinks/cleaning costs, that'd be great!

Would you like to be a speaker? Apply here:

Feel free to invite other founders to join.

Thanks and looking forward to seeing you again :)
