# Startup Founders meetup at Persona HQ

![HQ meetup](../images/1698254820695_45b165504467.jpeg)

Founders, founders-to-be, visionaries, investors - let's connect!

This is our last meetup of the year to happen early in December.

I wanted to do something different this time.

I want us to have more intentional discussions, to talk a bit about reflections on 2023 and a forward-looking for 2024, where you need help, where you can contribute, and whatnot.

We'll organize some snacks and great chats here at the Persona HQ in SF.
