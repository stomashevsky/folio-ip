# Documents AI/Verification: Expired Detection Check

# Overview[](#overview)

**Expired Detection Check** in Document Verification Templates helps determine whether a submitted document has passed its expiration date. This is especially useful for time-sensitive document types, such as government IDs, such as passports and driver’s licenses, where expired documents are no longer valid and should not be accepted.

This check is configurable, allowing you to automatically flag or reject expired documents based on your specific compliance and business requirements.

## Configure Expired Check[](#configure-expired-check)

7.  Check the box under **Required** if the entire verification should fail when this check is not passed.

Required Verification checks affect whether a Verification attempt passes or fails. Every required check must pass in order for a Verification attempt to pass.  
Non-required Verification checks do not affect whether a Verification attempt passes or fails.

8.  Click **Save** on the top right.

## Why Expired Checks are important[](#why-expired-checks-are-important)

Expired Checks are critical when you need to ensure that:

-   Documents are still valid and have not passed their expiration date.
-   You meet regulatory requirements that mandate acceptance of only current, unexpired documents.
-   Fraud risk is reduced by rejecting expired documents that may have been tampered with or recycled.

With configurable settings, Persona gives you control over how expired documents are handled based on your organizational needs.
