# I see a "Can't access your camera" error.

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

If you received this error message during the Persona verification flow, you will need to enable camera permissions for your device and/or browser in order to complete the flow.

How you enable camera permissions depends on your browser and device type.
