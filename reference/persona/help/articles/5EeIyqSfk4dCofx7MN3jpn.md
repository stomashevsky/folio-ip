# How can I see which verification checks are "Required" for an Inquiry?

Follow these steps to see which checks are required for an Inquiry to pass the verification process:

1.  In the navigation bar in the Persona Dashboard, select **Inquiries** > **All Inquiries**.
2.  Select the Inquiry you're interested in.
3.  On the Inquiry page, select the **Verifications** tab at the top of the page.
4.  On the Verifications tab, you'll see a section for each Verification attempt the end user made in this Inquiry.
5.  For each Verification attempt:
    -   Find the Checks section.
        -   This section contains a table with all the individual verification checks run on this attempt.
        -   The Required column in this table tells you whether each check is required (‘Yes’ = required, ‘No’ = not required).
