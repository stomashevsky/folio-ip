# How to revert to a previously published Inquiry Template Version or Workflow Version

⚠️ This question came from a member of the Persona Community - a compliance leader who was trying to understand how best to revert a set of changes. This question is useful for those looking to revert a published Inquiry Template or Workflow to an older published version that contained desired configurations, experiences, and/or steps for end users.

At Persona, we understand that changes to Inquiry Templates or Workflows can sometimes lead to unexpected issues. To ensure minimal disruption, we provide the ability to revert to previous stable versions of both Inquiry Templates and Workflows.
