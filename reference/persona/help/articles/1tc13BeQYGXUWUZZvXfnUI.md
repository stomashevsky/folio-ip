Cases are Persona products that collect together data on an end user to allow for manual investigation and decisioning on. Your organization may need to investigate this user for a variety of reasons:

-   **Onboarding**: Should this user be allowed to onboard to the platform?
-   **Account takeover investigation**: If a user is claiming that their account has been taken over, is there enough information to validate their claim?
-   **Fraudulent activity**: Are there suspicious signals associated with this user that require further action (e.g. account freezing, sending a follow-up inquiry for verification, etc.)?
-   **Transaction monitoring review**: Are there suspicious transactions associated with this user that require further investigation?

Case comments are useful for providing additional context or notes related to the case. They help in maintaining a record of discussions or decisions made during the case review process. The Add Comment To Case step lets you automate some of those communications.
