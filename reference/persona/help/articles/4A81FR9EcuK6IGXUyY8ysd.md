How many seats does my plan have?

# Answer[](#answer)

Thank you for your question about seat limitations in Persona plans.

Persona has no seat limitations on any plan. You can invite teammates to your instance as you see fit.

We often receive questions about seat limitations for specific features like the Cases product. Rest assured, there are no seat limitations for Cases or any other Persona product.

Since Persona is a system of record for your users and identities, limiting to a certain number of people just isn’t aligned with how we know digital businesses work.

Our plans, instead, are designed to serve businesses of all sizes and to grow alongside you (whether it means customizable services or add-on products, or starter plans with commonly used solutions). The hope is to help as many teams as possible tackle these challenging digital identity problems through our plan offerings.
