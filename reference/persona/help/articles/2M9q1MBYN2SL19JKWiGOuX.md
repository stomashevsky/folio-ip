# Troubleshoot: Receiving SMS (text message)

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

## Overview[](#overview)

In your Persona verification flow, you may have the option to receive an SMS message from Persona. If you are having trouble receiving an SMS, see the steps below to troubleshoot.

## Troubleshoot a missing SMS[](#troubleshoot-a-missing-sms)

If you do NOT receive an SMS (text message) you expected:

-   **Check your "spam" messages**: Your messaging app may have sent Persona's message to a spam folder.
    -   On iPhone:
        -   Open the Messages app.
        -   If you see **Filters** in the top left corner, tap **Filters**.
        -   Select **Unknown Senders** from the list of options. This displays messages that were automatically filtered out from your main inbox.
        -   Look for a text message from Persona.
-   **Double-check your number**: Double-check that you have entered your phone number correctly. In your Persona flow, you may need to tap a "back" arrow to return to the screen where you entered your number.
-   **Resend the SMS**: In your Persona flow, you can request that Persona resend the SMS.
