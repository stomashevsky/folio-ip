Salesforce is a CRM platform that helps unify marketing, sales, service, commerce, and IT in personalizing every experience along the customer journey. Salesforce is available as a [Marketplace integration](./6YaRAGHHcXb6MQ0c6CGvbJ.md).

Persona’s Salesforce integration can be useful for streamlining and simplifying customer onboarding, improving customer data management, and more.

Once the integration is set up, you can trigger the following Salesforce actions inside your Workflows. _Note: If there are multiple options for these actions, choose the one with "OAuth" in the name._

-   Create Salesforce Record
-   Update Salesforce Record
-   Find Salesforce Record

Records map to the specific fields that exist within your Salesforce instance.
