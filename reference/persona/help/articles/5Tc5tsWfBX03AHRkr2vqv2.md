# Verification checks

## Overview[](#overview)

Once you have decided which Verification checks you want to require for a Verification type, you can configure them in the Dashboard. There are [different ways to create a verification](./3wK7xYJEsovSTTaZTAjXuU.md#2-within-a-workflow):

-   As part of an Inquiry (recommended)
-   With an API request
-   Within a Workflow

## Prerequisites[](#prerequisites)

-   Not sure which Verification checks you want? See [this guide](./3WnqX7N26sshPLKPQbuW4O.md) (written for Government ID Verification) as an example of how to think through it, and the full set of steps that may be involved to make a change.
-   The ability to configure required Verification checks is available on paid plans. If you're on the free plan and want to upgrade, please contact us [here](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us).
-   If your Verification check configurations are fully managed by your Persona team, you will not be able to edit them yourself. Please reach out to your customer success manager if you would like to make changes.
