# Document AI Enhanced

For organizations that are particularly sensitive to fraud, Document AI Enhanced offers the most advanced suite of fraud detection capabilities.

## How it works[](#how-it-works)

In addition to performing the classifications, extractions and checks that exist in the core product, Document AI Enhanced analyzes hundreds of visual, non-visual, and contextual fraud indicators, including digital edits and tampering, screenshot use, synthetic and generative AI documents, content inconsistencies, and more.

Upon completion of its fraud analysis, Document AI Enhanced assigns each document a composite risk score (High, Medium, Low, Minimal), and summarizes its output in the document viewer.

## The document viewer[](#the-document-viewer)

The document viewer is a visual surface that highlights both risk and trust indicators with visual overlays to help fraud reviewers quickly assess the fraud risk and make an accurate decision. ![Doc-Ai-Enhanced-Viewer](../images/Doc-Ai-Enhanced-Viewer_336396cc5868.png)
