# Plans Overview

## Plans[](#plans)

Persona offers simple and scalable pricing plans that fit any business’ needs. You can get started with the Essential plan or work with a member of our sales team to customize the Growth or Enterprise plans to your business.

For an overview of products, features, and services available on each plan, you can always visit the [pricing page](../../landing/pricing.md) to compare in detail.

**Persona offers three main plans for you to choose from: Enterprise plan, Growth plan, and Essential plan**

### Enterprise plan[](#enterprise-plan)

The Enterprise plan is for large organizations with multiple business units or with multiple international subsidiaries/departments. The Enterprise plan expands upon the Growth plan, giving it the ability to meet complex regulations or business needs. Enterprise plan customers tend to have multiple solutions implemented within Persona that drive highly strategic business value that Persona partners with you to achieve.

Comprehensive access to the Persona platform, products, features, and services is supplemented by unparalleled strategic partnership, guidance, and product support from our team of identity experts.

### Growth plan[](#growth-plan)

The Growth plan is our recommended plan for most businesses. The Growth plan gives business the best of Persona’s platform and products, with customized pricing for the services (verifications and reports) you plan to use the most often. Even more valuable, the Growth plan gives access to advanced platform features, including additional Report & Verification types, powerful configurations to prevent fraud, 3rd party marketplace data and productivity app integrations, Graph for deep bad actor investigations, and advanced Cases features to build scalable operational team review processes.

The Growth plan is great for businesses scaling their online presence, mid-stage/fast-growing startups, and businesses looking to transform their digital operations. The plan also includes various options for implementation and/or ongoing account and product support from our team of digital identity experts. Many Growth plan customers are mid- to late-stage startups in marketplace, fintech, proptech, and digital health spaces. Moreover, customers on the Growth plan also include public sector entities.

### Essential plan[](#essential-plan)

The Essential plan allows businesses to get started with Persona’s most popular products & services with basic platform access and trusted off-the-shelf solutions to get you started (accessible via the Solution Library in your dashboard). This plan is a self-guided plan with an exclusive invitation to the Persona Community to help supplement your learning and ability to optimize your solution over time.

The Essential plan is great for small and medium-sized businesses interested in getting started with Persona and who are willing to learn by doing and implement their own configurations and solutions. Many Essential plan customers are venture-backed early-stage fintech, proptech, and marketplace startups.

This plan starts at $250/month (on an annual contract) and includes 500 free services (verifications or reports) per month, with any additional services beyond that free allotment priced at $1.50 per service. For many Essential plan customers, this means if the volume of services is below 500 per month, the monthly cost is just $250.

Note that the 500 free services per month do not roll over. Any unused services at the end of the billing cycle are expired and do not carry over to the next monthly cycle.

**Trialing the Essential plan**

To get started with Persona, you can start a free trial with no credit card required. During the 60-day trial, you’ll have full access to the features available under the **Essential** plan (up to 50 services). By default the trial only features access to a Sandbox environment. Additional information and a business verification review from our compliance team may is required to request a trial with a Production environment.

During your trial period, if you’re interested in pursuing or subscribing to a Persona plan, you may choose one by going to **Organization > Billing** (or click “Explore plans” in the banner at the top of the dashboard).

If your trial ends and you have not chosen a plan, you instance will be deactivated but you still have access to your data but will not be able to implement any new changes. From there, if you wish to continue using Persona, you can choose a suitable plan via **Organization > Billing**, or simply create a new organization. Businesses are only allowed one trial experience and extensions for trials are uncommon.
