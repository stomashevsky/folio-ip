The Footer component allows you to style and customize the bottom section of the screen. Content added to this block will stay at the bottom of the screen. Footers often contain company logos, important links to key pages like “Privacy Policy” or “Contact Us”, or displaying social media icons and navigation options. Footers provide a consistent, accessible space for important information.

# Styles[](#styles)

You can customize how your component appears to users in the Styles tab, modifying elements like spacing, layout, color, and borders.

## Spacing[](#spacing)

Padding can be adjusted on all four sides of the Footer component (top, left, bottom, right) to control the spacing between it and the edge of the screen. Increasing padding creates more space inside the **Footer**, ensuring its content doesn’t feel cramped and aligns neatly with the overall design.

## Layout[](#layout)

The alignment options allow for control over the positioning of elements, offering vertical alignment choices (left, center, right) and a horizontal alignment with a reverse direction checkbox to adjust the layout direction as needed.

## Colors[](#colors)

Setting a background color allows you to customize the visual appearance of the **Footer**, providing contrast and enhancing the overall design.

## Border[](#border)

You can add a border to all four sides of the Footer component (top, left, bottom, right) for custom styling. Adding a border radius creates rounded edges, which softens the **Footer's** appearance for a more modern look. You can also customize the border's color to match your design.
