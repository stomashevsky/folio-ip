# I see a "Session Expired" error.

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

If you started your verification flow, and then left the flow (for example, by closing your browser window) before you completed it, your session will expire for security reasons.
