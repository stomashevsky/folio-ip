### What are tips for submitting a photo of my government ID?[](#what-are-tips-for-submitting-a-photo-of-my-government-id)

General Tips:

-   Make sure the lighting in the room is bright enough to capture the ID.
-   If there is glare in your photo, move away from direct light to reduce glare.
-   Make sure the text on your ID is readable (and not worn).
-   Make sure you are not covering any part of the ID (e.g., with your finger).
-   Make sure the photo of your face on the ID is visible.
-   Make sure the image is not blurry.
-   If your ID continues to fail, try another ID type, if available.
-   If your camera quality is poor (e.g., the image is grainy or small) or you do not have a camera on your device, you can upload a photo of your ID and make sure it meets the above requirements. You can also text message or e-mail yourself a link to continue on your phone with your phone's camera.

For ID Cards:

-   If possible, place the ID card on a flat surface (e.g., a table) with a dark background to reduce blur.
-   Move the ID card as close to the camera as possible, while making sure all four corners of the ID are captured within the photo.

For Passports:

-   Hold the passport open to the main passport page (showing your photo and personal details).
-   Make sure you are not blocking any part of the main passport page.
-   Make sure the MRZ (the symbols and letters at the bottom of your passport page) is fully visible and can be read clearly in your photo.
-   Because passport pages can be glossy, please make sure the lighting is good and move away from a direct lighting source to avoid glare or reflection.

For Selfies

-   Make sure you are in a well-lit area
-   Move away from a direct lighting source to avoid any glare in your selfie
-   Follow all prompts and instructions presented to you on the screen
