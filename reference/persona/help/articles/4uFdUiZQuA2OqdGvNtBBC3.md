# Overview[](#overview)

Persona has partnered with **Australian Payments Plus** to integrate **ConnectID** into our platform.

ConnectID enables end users to securely share verified identity and age claims directly from their financial institutions. They do so by managing a network of Australian identity service providers and partners with major Australian banks.

> **Note:** It is important to note that **neither Persona nor ConnectID ever sees or stores personal information** received by participating ConnectID partners, preserving user privacy throughout the process. Only the necessary and consented claims such as name and address matches or age thresholds are passed back to Persona.

# Frequently Asked Questions[](#frequently-asked-questions)

### Does Persona have access to my banking information?[](#does-persona-have-access-to-my-banking-information)

**No.** The sign in page is hosted by your banking provider and Persona will not access your bank details or account information. You’ll get to review the claims that will be shared with Persona before you give consent. If your bank has verified your identity, they will confirm your full name and date of birth.

### What data is shared?[](#what-data-is-shared)

Users are always shown exactly which claims are being requested before any transaction occurs. The specific claims requested depend entirely on the use case.

-   **For organisations verifying for Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age Act:** The only claim requested will be **Over16**, which verifies whether the bank account is owned by someone who is 16 years of age or older
-   **For KYC and fraud use cases:** The claims will let us know whether we can verify your details that include one or more of the following matches:
    -   Name
    -   Phone
    -   Email
    -   Address
    -   Birthdate

### Does Persona or ConnectID save any bank details?[](#does-persona-or-connectid-save-any-bank-details)

**No.** Neither Persona nor ConnectID has access to any information via ConnectID beyond what is consented to for any given use case.

### Does ConnectID store my information?[](#does-connectid-store-my-information)

**No.** ConnectID does not collect or store personal information at any time, it’s just the bridge that connects the bank and Persona when you authorise it.
