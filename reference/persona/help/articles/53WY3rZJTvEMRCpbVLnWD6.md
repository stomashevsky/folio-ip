# Troubleshoot: Receiving email

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

## Overview[](#overview)

In your Persona verification flow, you may have the option to receive an email from Persona. If you are having trouble receiving an email, use this guide to troubleshoot.

## Troubleshoot a missing email[](#troubleshoot-a-missing-email)

If you do NOT receive an email you expected:

-   **Check your "spam" folder**: Your email may have been sent to a spam folder by your email provider. 
-   **Double-check spelling**: Double-check that you have spelled your email address correctly. In your Persona flow, you may need to tap a "back" arrow to return to the screen where you entered your email address.
-   **Resend the email**: In your Persona flow, you can request that Persona resend the email.
