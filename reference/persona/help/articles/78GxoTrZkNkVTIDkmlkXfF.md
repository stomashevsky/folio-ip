# What is the Add Item To List step?[](#what-is-the-add-item-to-list-step)

**Add Item To List** is a Workflow Action step that adds an item to a Persona list, which helps you maintain lists of data such as email addresses, IP addresses, or government ID numbers that can be used for matching against future inquiries or transactions.

Lists are particularly useful for enhancing security, compliance, and operational efficiency. Some examples of this include:

-   **Fraud Prevention**: Maintain a list of known fraudulent email addresses, IP addresses, or identities to automatically flag or block suspicious activities.
-   **Compliance Checks**: Create lists of sanctioned individuals or entities to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements by checking against these lists during verification processes.
-   **VIP Customer Management**: Manage a list of VIP customers to provide them with prioritized service or special handling during interactions.
-   **Access Control**: Use lists to manage access to certain features or services by maintaining a whitelist or blacklist of users or entities.
-   **Marketing and Engagement**: Segment customers into lists based on specific criteria, such as geographic location or purchase history, to tailor marketing campaigns or engagement strategies.

The Add Item To List step allows you to automatically add relevant information to a list, keeping it relevant and useful. For example, you may flag a new email address as fraudulent, then use the Add Item To List step to add it to your known fraudulent emails list.
