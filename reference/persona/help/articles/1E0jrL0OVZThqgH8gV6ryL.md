How do I display the maximum allowable size of documents that users can upload?

# Answer[](#answer)

You can show users the maximum file size by adding instructional text to your Inquiry Template. This helps set expectations before they reach a document upload step.

1.  in the Dashboard, go to **Inquiries > Templates** and select the Template you want to edit.
2.  In the Flow Editor, either:
    1.  Click on the document upload screen’s `Edit` button, to add text directly before the upload step.
    2.  Click the `+` icon that appears before the document upload screen, to add a new screen dedicated specifically towards this instruction.
3.  If editing existing text, click on the text and add instruction such as “The maximum file size you can upload is 10MB.”
4.  If adding new text, click on Component Library, and drag-and-drop a Text component onto your screen. Edit its contents to include instruction such as “The maximum file size you can upload is 10MB.”
5.  **Edit translations** if necessary to update all translated versions of your text.
6.  Click **Save** to save changes.

For Enterprise customers, contact support if you need to change the maximum file size limit for Inquiry document uploads.
