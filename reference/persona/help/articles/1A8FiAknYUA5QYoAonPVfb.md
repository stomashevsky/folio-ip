# How do I find Non-Latin Inquires?

❓This question came from a member of the Persona community - a project manager who was trying to track International Inquiries. This question is useful for those who want to be able to find inquiries for end users using non-latin alphabets.

When Persona extracts PII like names and addresses from submitted documents, it translates any non-latin characters into latin characters. This can make it tricky to search for those end users if you don’t know the latin version of the words.

In this situation we recommend using a translation app, like [google translate](https://translate.google.com/), to convert your non-latin characters to English. This translation might still be a letter or two off, so searching in Persona for a full first, middle, and last name might be too specific to match correctly. Try searching just the first name and check if any of the hits have the right last name. If the first name has no matches, try removing letters from the end of the first name until you do have a match and see if any have the right or similar last name. You can use this same process if you want to start with the last name instead or even for addresses and other searchable PII.
