A Persona Inquiry represents a single instance of an individual attempting to verify their identity. Inquiries are created when the individual begins to verify their identity, and contains the information collected from the submitted verifications, the results of those verifications, and passively-collected contextual data like IP address that can be used to identify suspicious activity.

Inquiries are usually automatically `approved` or `declined` based on a workflow. Manual review, as set by the Mark Inquiry For Review step, allows your team to manually assess an inquiry to determine next steps, such as approving or declining it.

This action is typically part of a workflow that automates the decision-making process on whether a manual or automatic review is appropriate, ensuring that inquiries meeting certain conditions are reviewed by a human for accuracy or compliance.
