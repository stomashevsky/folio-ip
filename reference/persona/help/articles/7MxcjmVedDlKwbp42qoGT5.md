# Inquiries Enhanced Features

# Overview[](#overview)

Persona offers two tiers for Inquiries: **Inquiries Basic** and **Inquiries Enhanced**. An Inquiry Template can either be Basic or Enhanced, and is primarily a concept focused on how a customer is billed for Inquiries. In your Persona Dashboard, you will typically come across these tiers when interacting or viewing Inquiry Templates. And whether an Inquiry Template is marked as Enhanced will tell you whether or not your business will be billed for that Inquiry Template according to the pricing on your order form or contract.

In addition to billing, the Inquiry tier also indicates what features your organization has access to when editing or configuring an Inquiry Template. For example, Essential plan customers only have access to Inquiries Basic per the Essential Plan order form and therefore do not have access to some of the advanced features available on Inquiries Enhanced. Customers on Custom, Growth, or Enterprise plans should refer to their order form to confirm access to Basic or Enhanced. Some organizations only have access to Inquiries Basic.

| Plan or Program | Inquiries Basic | Inquiries Enhanced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Essential plan | Has Access | No Access |
| Growth plan | Refer to order form for access | Refer to order form for access |
| Enterprise plan | Refer to order form for access | Refer to order form for access |
| Custom plan | Refer to order form for access | Refer to order form for access |
| Startup program | Limited | No Access |

For organizations who have access to both Inquiries Basic and Inquiries Enhanced, their Inquiry Templates can either be Basic or Enhanced depending on what features are used. Whether or not the Inquiry Template is marked as Enhanced determines how it will be billed according to that organization's specific order form.

For organizations with access to Inquiries Basic only, Inquiries Enhanced features are not available for use.
