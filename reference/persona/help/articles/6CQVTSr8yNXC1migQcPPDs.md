# What is the Set Case SLA step?[](#what-is-the-set-case-sla-step)

**Set Case SLA** is a Workflow Action step that sets the Service Level Agreement (SLA) deadline for a case.

Cases are a Persona product that organizes and presents data and other Persona objects (i.e. Inquiries, Verifications, Accounts, Reports) on an end user to allow for manual investigation and decisioning. They are often used as part of an escalation process. Your organization may need to investigate users or attempts at verification for a variety of reasons:

-   **Onboarding**: Should this user be allowed to onboard to the platform if there are risky signals?
-   **Account takeover investigation**: If a user is claiming that their account has been taken over, is there enough information to validate their claim?
-   **Fraudulent activity**: Are there suspicious signals associated with this user that require further action (e.g. account freezing, sending a follow-up inquiry for verification, etc.)?
-   **Transaction monitoring review**: Are there suspicious transactions associated with this user that require further investigation?

## Why should cases have SLA deadlines?[](#why-should-cases-have-sla-deadlines)

A Case in Persona can have an SLA deadline to help ensure cases are reviewed and resolved within a specific time frame. This can be important for meeting compliance requirements and maintaining operational efficiency.

The SLA deadline also allows organizations to prioritize cases based on urgency and ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner. By setting deadlines, teams can avoid backlogs and ensure that cases are handled according to the agreed-upon timelines.

You can set deadlines to be listed in minutes, hours, or days.
