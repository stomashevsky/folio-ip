✍🏻 This feature only applies to recurrable reports:

-   Watchlist (person & business)

To set up recurrable reports, see [here](./7LRMBbxLshF7sCcLhfhwF4.md).

## Flag Issue[](#flag-issue)

Flagging an issue via Reports will automatically create a ticket sent to Persona’s support team. They will review the ticket to understand the issue and reach out with any questions.

Common examples of issues that would be relevant to flag here would be issues with matches or a Report not running when it should.
