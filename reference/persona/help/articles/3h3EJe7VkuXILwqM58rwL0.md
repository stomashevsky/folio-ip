# How Persona identity verification works

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

## What is Persona?[](#what-is-persona)

Persona provides a powerful, secure platform to help organizations verify the identity of individuals online. We aim to build a safer and more accessible internet by helping organizations verify that their users are who they say they are.

If you landed here after being asked to verify your identity through a link, app, or website—maybe while creating an account, resetting a password, or recovering access to something important—the identity verification experience you went through was likely powered by Persona.

## What to do if you're having trouble verifying your identity with Persona[](#what-to-do-if-youre-having-trouble-verifying-your-identity-with-persona)

**Persona provides the technology behind identity verification, but we don’t decide who gets verified, what information is required, or what happens if you’re unable to complete the process.** Those decisions are made by the business or organization that sent you to Persona.

So if you’re stuck on a step, unsure why you were asked to verify, or wondering what to do next, **the best thing to do is contact the company that requested the verification.** They’ll have the full context on your situation and can help you move forward.

We know this can be frustrating—especially if you're dealing with something time-sensitive. While Persona works closely with our customers to make the experience as smooth and secure as possible, ultimately, they control how verification is configured and what steps are required.

## General tips for verifying your identity[](#general-tips-for-verifying-your-identity)

While we can’t troubleshoot individual cases, we do have a general guide with tips that might help. It includes advice on lighting, glare, device positioning, and what to expect during government ID, NFC, or selfie capture steps.
