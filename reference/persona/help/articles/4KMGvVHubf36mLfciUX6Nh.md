# How do I configure country options for a Country Select screen?

## Overview[](#overview)

The Country Select screen may be part of your identity verification flow.

For example, if you use Government ID Verification in your flow, you may use a Country Select screen at the start of your flow to communicate which countries you accept IDs from, and to collect a data point that helps you understand what users submit.

You can configure which countries appear as options on the Country Select screen.
