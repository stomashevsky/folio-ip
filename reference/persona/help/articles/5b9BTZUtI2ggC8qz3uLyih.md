# Visualizing Account Relationships[](#visualizing-account-relationships)

The Account Relationship Visualization module provides a powerful way to visualize and manage complex account relationships, such as those between businesses and their Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs). With this feature, organizations can model relationships in a nested tree structure to get a comprehensive view of interconnected accounts.

By surfacing ownership and account links in one place, the module helps teams streamline compliance and due diligence while strengthening fraud detection. Suspicious relationships that may otherwise go unnoticed become easier to identify and act on.

## How the Account Relationship Visualization Module works[](#how-the-account-relationship-visualization-module-works)

#### 1\. Access and visualize relationships[](#1-access-and-visualize-relationships)

Navigate to the **Accounts page** for a given entity or view the **Accounts module** within a Case. Once the module is attached, you can explore account connections in a nested tree format.

Each node displays the fields defined in your account type—no need to expand to view them. Use the **Load more** button to pull in additional relationships as needed.

#### 2\. Add and edit accounts inline[](#2-add-and-edit-accounts-inline)

-   To add a related account, click the **Add account relation** button in an account node and follow the prompts.
-   To update account information, click the **pencil icon** in an account node and edit directly in the module.

#### 3\. Custom actions (future release)[](#3-custom-actions-future-release)
