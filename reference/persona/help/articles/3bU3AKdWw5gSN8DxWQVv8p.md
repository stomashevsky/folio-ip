Why should I disable image uploads?

# Answer[](#answer)

By default, most Inquiry Templates are configured such that end users can either **capture a new photo** using their camera or **upload an existing image** from their device. For some businesses or user experiences, allowing uploads may introduce risk: uploaded files can be reused, shared, or spoofed. For this reason, some teams choose to disable uploads to encourage in-the-moment, harder-to-fake captures.
