**Remove Tag** is a Workflow Action step that removes a Tag or Tags from a specific Persona object, such as an Account or Inquiry.

Tags are used to organize and classify accounts or inquiries based on specific characteristics or conditions. Tags reflect attributes that are unlikely to change during the verification process, such as “Under 21 years old”, “Non-eligible geo”, or “Watchlist match”. However, Remove Tag is useful for situations when those attributes change.

They help in filtering and managing objects by providing additional context or status that can be useful for decision-making or further processing.

💡 Tags should be used to mark certain conditions or states that are relevant to your organization’s needs.
