# My verification link has expired

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

For security reasons, each link will expire. By default, your link expires 24 hours after it was created, but the organization that directed you to the Persona flow may change this default.

_**If you would like to resume your verification, please reach out to the organization that directed you to the Persona flow.**_
