Why did my email attachment fail?

# Answer[](#answer)

There are a few reasons why an attachment may fail when using the Cases email module. Below you’ll find some of the most common issues.

## File type issues[](#file-type-issues)

The following is a list of supported file types that can be attached to an email within the module.

| **File Type** | **Supported** |
| --- | --- |
| `.PDF` | ✅ |
| `.HEIC` | ✅ |
| `.PNG` | ✅ |
| `.JPEG` | ✅ |
| `.JPG` | ✅ |
| `.XLSX` | ✅ |
| `.XLS` | ✅ |
| `.CSV` | ✅ |
| `.DOCX` | ✅ |
| `.TXT` | ✅ |
| `.ZIP` | ✅ |
| `.TSV` | ✅ |

## Attachment size issues[](#attachment-size-issues)

Please note that there is a limit of `15 MB` for attachments per email (including threaded replies from the earlier parts of the email conversation). This means you can generally include one file of up to `15 MB` or up to three files of `5 MB` each.

⚠️ If you need to share email attachments larger than \`15 MB\` or of an unsupported file type, we recommend uploading them to Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox. Once uploaded, please share the link directly in your email.

When attaching files, keep in mind that the total size of the email—including the content and any threads—can affect the maximum attachment size. For instance, if your email has a lot of HTML content or is part of a long thread, the limit may be lower than `15 MB`.

For end users, replying to an email conversation with an attachment, some email clients (i.e. Gmail) may notify when a message cannot be sent due to size restrictions.
