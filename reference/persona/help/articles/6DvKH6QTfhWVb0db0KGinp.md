# I see a "Failed to capture screenshot and/or the Play icon" error when I take a photo.

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

If you've encountered this issue, check that your device has **Low Power Mode** turned off and is sufficiently charged.

Your device limits video function to save battery power. This is why you see the failed to capture message when trying to submit your government ID or selfie.
