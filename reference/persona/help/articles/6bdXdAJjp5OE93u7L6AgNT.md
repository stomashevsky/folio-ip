# Screen Step components in Inquiries

# Overview[](#overview)

Components are the building blocks of designing your flow inside the Flow Editor. You can drag and drop components from the Component Library to arrange them on screens inside the Screen Editing View.

This capability is currently only available to customers on the beta version of Flow Editor. If you're interested in joining the beta, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager or [contact the Persona support team](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us).

## Using Component Styles, Properties, and Fields[](#using-component-styles-properties-and-fields)

For each component, you will see Styles, Properties, and Fields if applicable.

Styles lets you set sizing, spacing, and other attributes for each component.

Properties lets you set behaviors for your components or translations.

Fields are used for Form components to designate how to structure information collected from your end-users. Note that once you save a template, you can not edit a key name for a field.
