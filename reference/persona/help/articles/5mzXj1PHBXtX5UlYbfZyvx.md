# Transactions overview

## About Transactions[](#about-transactions)

Transactions are one of Persona's core objects. You can use them with Workflows to do any sort of orchestration across Persona and your own systems.

Transactions are defined by you and represent a distinct user journey or event in your product. Transactions can take the form of things like user onboarding, a loan application, a withdrawal of funds, or a hotel room booking.

## Transactions are defined by you[](#transactions-are--defined-by-you)

Transactions are ultimately defined by you so you can model any significant event in your systems. Combined with Workflows, this enables you to:

1.  Map the result of one Persona product to one business decision.
2.  Translate a sequence of results in Persona, across our products, into a single business decision.
3.  Combine your data with Persona results to form a single business decision.

### Transactions sits along Accounts and are integrated via Workflows[](#transactions-sits-along-accounts-and-are-integrated-via-workflows)

If Accounts are the "who" of Persona, Transactions are the "what". For more information about Accounts, visit the [overview](./2gE7mjjLCIGJPnK6mTyjU9/accounts-overview.md).

Workflows, Persona's automation tool, can then be used to perform any type of action on a Transaction or Accounts. For more information about Workflows, visit the [overview](../workflows.md).

### Transactions and Workflows facilitate API-first and data orchestration integrations with Persona.[](#transactions-and-workflows-facilitate-api-first-and-data-orchestration-integrations-with-persona)

Transactions and Workflows facilitate API-first and data orchestration integrations with Persona. For instance, if you want to run multiple DB verifications via API, you can do so via Transactions and make one API call to a Transaction that kicks off the verification instead of multiple API calls to different Persona products.
