A Persona Inquiry represents a single instance of an individual attempting to verify their identity. Inquiries are created when the individual begins to verify their identity, and contains the information collected from the submitted verifications, the results of those verifications, and passively-collected contextual data like IP address that can be used to identify suspicious activity.

If necessary verifications are not passed and manual review is not required, an Inquiry can be officially declined - this is commonly referred to as auto-declining. The Decline Inquiry step is useful for automatically triggering Inquiry denial after certain checks have failed in your Workflow.
