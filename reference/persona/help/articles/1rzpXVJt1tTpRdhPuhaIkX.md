## Creating the CSV template[](#creating-the-csv-template)

For a successful upload:

-   Please do not change, add, remove, or move the header names in the CSV template.
-   Provide the required input(s) for each record.
-   Ensure each CSV has no more than 10,000 rows.
    -   If you would like to bulk create reports for more than 10,000 rows, break them into multiple smaller CSVs that meet the size requirement. Then, upload each of the smaller CSVs.
