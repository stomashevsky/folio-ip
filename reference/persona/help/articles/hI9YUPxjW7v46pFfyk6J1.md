# Reports Overview

_The ability to use Reports is available on paid plans. If you're on the free plan and want to upgrade, please contact us [here](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us). Pricing for each Report varies depending on the Report type and the plan that your organization is on._

## About Reports[](#about-reports)

### Enrich identity profiles[](#enrich-identity-profiles)

Reports provide additional information about an end user beyond what they submit directly in an Inquiry. Inquiries collect information directly from an individual, while Reports pull information from authoritative and non-authoritative data sources. These authoritative data sources include credentials, attestations, records, logs, investigations, and analyses. Adverse Media Reports may also include articles.

### Stay compliant, prevent fraud[](#stay-compliant-prevent-fraud)

Organizations who use Reports through Persona often need additional information about an individual before completing their identity verification process. Common use cases include KYC/AML compliance and fraud prevention.
