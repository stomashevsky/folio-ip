# Profile Report

## About Profile Report[](#about-profile-report)

The Profile Report enriches the personal identity information of your users. Given partial PII about a user (such as a phone number or last 4 digits of an SSN), you can obtain related PII (such as associated phone numbers or full SSN).

## Use cases[](#use-cases)

You can use a Profile Report to:

-   **Ensure customer data is complete.** Pre-fill or obtain required data, such as SSN, for Know Your Customer (KYC) / Customer Identification Program (CIP) compliance.
-   **Ensure customer data is accurate.** Detect and correct common user input errors, such as off-by-1 typos, by corroborating your users' inputs against authoritative data sources.

The Profile Report may help you achieve business goals such as:

-   Expanding access to thin file applicants.
-   Conducting enhanced due diligence for risky transactions.

## Eligibility[](#eligibility)

To use the Profile Report, you must complete a business due diligence process. Eligibility is currently limited to US-based B2C institutions that have a permissible use case and have been incorporated for more than a year.
