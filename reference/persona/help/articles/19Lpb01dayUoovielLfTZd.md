# Workflows: Send SMS step

# What is the Send SMS step?[](#what-is-the-send-sms-step)

**Send SMS** is a Workflow Action step that sends a message to a user in an SMS message.

Phone numbers and messages can be pulled from other Workflow steps, triggers, or hardcoded to a specific value. This lets you automate communications such as updates and notifications to your users, as part of a Workflow.

⚠️ We recommend formatting your SMS message content for clarity. For example, use brief and precise language, and include any action needed from the user.

The Send SMS step is particularly useful when you need your user to take action, or when they should know that a critical process has completed or failed. It will often get a recipients attention faster than the Send Email step will.

It's common to use the Send SMS step sparingly and only when proper consents from users are collected.
