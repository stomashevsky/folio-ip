# What is a Screen Step?[](#what-is-a-screen-step)

Screen Step is a single page that an end user sees in an Inquiry Flow. It allows for fully configurable elements such as text, spacing, images, and custom logic.

![WhatIsAScreenStep](../images/WhatIsAScreenStep_563f2f632640.png) _The Start Screen and Country Select Screen are examples of Screen Steps. Some Screen Steps, like these two, are pre-built while others can be created or added to further customize the user experience._

## Where do you add a Screen Step?[](#where-do-you-add-a-screen-step)

1.  To access this feature, navigate to `Inquiries` —> `Templates` from the left nav and select any Inquiry template.
2.  A Screen step can be added by clicking the plus sign located between screens or by double clicking any existing screens. Some pre-built screens are available as modules.

The Screen Step allows you to personalize the user interface by adding and arranging text, images, and additional components, to create the precise layout and visual theme you desire for each step. You can style your screen steps with a selection of colors, fonts, and margins to match your company’s branding and design guidelines.

### Customized user experiences[](#customized-user-experiences)

Go beyond the limitations of pre-configured modules by embedding custom logic into your screen steps. Display dynamic content that changes based on user interactions and input, and enrich the user journey with personalized touch points.

### Pre-built Screen Steps[](#pre-built-screen-steps)
