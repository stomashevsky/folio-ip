**Assign Case** is a Workflow Action step that assigns a particular case to an organization staff member or team for review.

Cases are Persona products that collect together data on an end user to allow for manual investigation and decisioning on. Your organization may need to investigate this user for a variety of reasons:

-   **Onboarding**: Should this user be allowed to onboard to the platform?
-   **Account takeover investigation**: If a user is claiming that their account has been taken over, is there enough information to validate their claim?
-   **Fraudulent activity**: Are there suspicious signals associated with this user that require further action (e.g. account freezing, sending a follow-up inquiry for verification, etc.)?
-   **Transaction monitoring review**: Are there suspicious transactions associated with this user that require further investigation?

When a Case is created, it needs to be assigned to someone to reviewing and decisioning on. The Assign Case step lets you automate this, so that certain cases are always processed by the same individuals or teams within your organization. This ensures cases are always handled by the appropriate people and do not get lost.
