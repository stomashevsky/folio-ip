# Where do I find a coverage map or coverage details for the Database Verification type?

⚠️ This question came from a member of the Persona Community - a product manager working on onboarding users from multiple countries. It is useful for those looking to understand the coverage of the Database Verification service offered through Persona.

# Question[](#question)

**How do I find out which countries the Database Verification supports?**

I know that for each country there are different attributes that can be verified. Specifically, which combinations of the following attributes—name, birthdate, address, phone number, email, and identification number—can be verified, and how much coverage should I expect?

Another aspect I’m considering is the verification of identification numbers. Given that each country has different numbers and some have multiple national identification numbers, which identification numbers for each country can be verified?

# Answer[](#answer)

This is a great question! Database verification is an excellent way to start the identity verification or proofing process because most people worldwide are accustomed to providing their information, and the Database Verification runs seamlessly in the background. The complexity lies in the fact that authoritative databases vary by country, and thus, the emphasis on verifiable information differs for each country.

You need to be mindful of what information is collected per country. Thankfully, Persona provides coverage details in an easy-to-read table or chart to help you navigate this.
