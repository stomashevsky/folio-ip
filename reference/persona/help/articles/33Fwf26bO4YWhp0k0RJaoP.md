# Documents AI/Verification: Recency/Effective Detection Check

# Overview[](#overview)

**Recency/Effective Detection Check** for Document Verifications helps determine whether a submitted document is recent enough to be considered valid. This is especially useful for time-sensitive document types, such as proof of address, where older documents may not meet compliance or business requirements.

This check is configurable, allowing you to define what counts as “recent” based on your specific use case.

## Configure Recency/Effective Check[](#configure-recencyeffective-check)

1.  Navigate to the Dashboard, and click on **Inquiries > Templates** (or **Verifications > Templates**).
2.  Find and select an Inquiry template with Document AI, or **Create** a new template.
3.  In the top right, click **Configure**.

7.  Update the text box to define the number of days that qualify a document as recent. The default is 90 days.
8.  Check the box under **Required** if the entire verification should fail when this check is not passed.

Required Verification checks affect whether a Verification attempt passes or fails. Every required check must pass in order for a Verification attempt to pass.  
Non-required Verification checks do not affect whether a Verification attempt passes or fails.

9.  Click **Save** on the top right.

## Why Recency/Effective Checks are important[](#why-recencyeffective-checks-are-important)

Recency/Effective Checks are critical when you need to ensure that:

-   Documents reflect up-to-date information (e.g. recent bills, bank statements).
-   You meet regulatory requirements that specify a valid issue window for documents.
-   Fraud risk is reduced by rejecting outdated or recycled documents.

With configurable settings, Persona gives you control over what’s considered “recent” based on your organizational needs.
