# How do I request a new Inquiry link?

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

If you started this flow on another device, please return to your original device and select “Continue on another device” to send yourself a new link.

Otherwise, please reach out to the organization that directed you to the Persona flow and request a new link.
