# What is the Create Transaction step?[](#what-is-the-create-transaction-step)

**Create Transaction** is a Workflow Action step that creates a new Transaction when triggered.

Transactions represent significant interactions or events (e.g. user onboarding, loan application journey, etc). While an Account in Persona represents a user or entity, a Transaction captures some event associated with that user/entity. Its fields are used to capture the necessary information for processing the transaction.

You define what types of transactions are possible based on what counts as significant events or user journeys in your product. Similarly, the fields that can be included in a transaction are flexible and can be tailored to your requirements.

Transactions are integrated via Workflows and tie automations across Persona objects and constructs. Transactions and Workflows connect all parts of the platform together and back to your own systems over time.

The Create Transaction step lets you automate transaction creation within your workflow, which helps automate your user journey and experience.
