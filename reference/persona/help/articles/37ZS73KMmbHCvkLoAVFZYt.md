## Using Omnisearch[](#using-omnisearch)

Use Omnisearch to find specific Persona objects, quickly jump to specific view, take action, and access useful resources.

### Find and look up Persona objects[](#find-and-look-up-persona-objects)

You can use Omnisearch to look up specific Persona objects by searching for the object ID, Reference ID (if applicable), or Identifier (if configured) to review results or identity data.
