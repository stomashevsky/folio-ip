# What is a Required Verification Check?

❓ This question came from a member of the Persona community—a project admin who was trying to collect certain information without impacting the verification process. This question is useful for those who want to understand or change which Inquiry Verification Checks are required.

If a Verification Check is required, it must be passed for an Inquiry as a whole to be marked “Completed." Depending on your organization's Persona plan, you may be able to adjust Verification Check requirements in your Inquiry Templates.
