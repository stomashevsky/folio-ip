# FAQ: For Reddit Users Using the Persona Service

Persona helps businesses verify their user’s identity. Our privacy policy explains our overall approach to privacy, but the exact details can vary depending on the customer we’re working with. We created this FAQ specifically for Reddit Users that are using our service to verify their age.

We know sharing personal information online is a significant matter. We take that responsibility seriously and want to give you clear, straightforward answers about how Persona works with Reddit to verify your age. Our goal is transparency—so you always know what’s happening with your data and why.

### 1\. What’s Persona’s role in verifying my age?[](#1-whats-personas-role-in-verifying-my-age)

Reddit is the data controller—they decide what information is collected, why it’s collected, and how it is used. Persona is the data processor—we only handle your information under Reddit’s instructions and with your consent. Everything we do is bound by the agreements we have with Reddit and the privacy rules that apply to both of us. In this case, Persona is collecting on behalf of Reddit, just your birthdate and the photographic information you submit when you choose ID upload or to take a selfie, for the purpose of verifying your age.
