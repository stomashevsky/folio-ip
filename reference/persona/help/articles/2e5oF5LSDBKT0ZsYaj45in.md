Where can I see a coverage map of which countries Persona can support?

# Answer[](#answer)

Persona supports customers all around the world with identity verification needs. Identities are complex and for each country, there are many nuances to what data, documents, or other evidence can help a business like yours understand if an individual is who they really say they are. To see which countries are supported (as well as the nuances per product), see our coverage maps below. Or, if you’d like to access the coverage maps directly from within your Persona dashboard, select **Documentation** in the left navigation menu and then **Coverage Map**.

_Note: Coverage maps are only accessible to customers with a current Persona plan or program. If your organization is currently trialing Persona, you will not see the coverage map in your dashboard or at the links below. Feel free to [contact us](./41TS6HAG3Kn4zjlmE8w6f5/how-do-i-contact-support.md) if you need more information about verification coverage._

### Government ID Verification[](#government-id-verification)

Our [Government ID coverage map](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/resources/coverage-map/government-id) lists countries in which we support at least one form of Government ID type, which may include Passport, Drivers License, National ID, or Other. Within these categories, we provide more granularity on whether the given ID type can be verified or extracted.

### Database Verification[](#database-verification)

Our [Database verification coverage map](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/resources/coverage-map/database) lists countries in which Persona can query authoritative databases to perform verifications for various inputs, such as Name, Address, Birthdate, National ID Number, Phone Number, and Email Address. The database verification checks that information provided by the end user matches a record in a known database.

### Document AI[](#document-ai)

Our [Document AI coverage map](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/resources/coverage-map/document-ai) lists countries in which Persona is able to collect and classify documents, or extract specific information fields from documents. For additional information on specific types of documents that are covered, reach out to your Customer Success Manager.

Persona is constantly evolving our products and features. If there are countries or ID types that you believe should be supported, our Verifications product team would love to hear from you and see if we can be helpful. Given that the world of government-issued identification cards is fast-evolving, vast, and complex, you can let us know about other coverage needs by [contacting our team](./41TS6HAG3Kn4zjlmE8w6f5/how-do-i-contact-support.md)
