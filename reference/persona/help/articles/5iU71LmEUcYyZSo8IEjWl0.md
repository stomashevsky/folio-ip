HubSpot is a CRM platform that connects everything scaling companies need to deliver a best-in-class customer experience into one place. Hubspot is available as a [Marketplace integration](./6YaRAGHHcXb6MQ0c6CGvbJ.md).

Persona’s Hubspot integration can be useful for streamlining and simplifying customer onboarding, improving customer data management, and more.

Once the integration is set up, you can trigger the following Hubspot actions inside your Workflows. _Note: If there are multiple options for these actions, choose the one with "OAuth" in the name._

-   Create Hubspot Object
-   Update Hubspot Object
-   Find Hubspot Object

Objects map to the specific fields that exist within your Hubspot instance.
