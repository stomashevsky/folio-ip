Zendesk is a customer service platform that empowers organizations to improve customer engagement and better understand their customers. Zendesk is available as a [Marketplace integration](./6YaRAGHHcXb6MQ0c6CGvbJ.md).

Persona’s Zendesk integration can be useful for streamlining and simplifying customer support, automating ticket management, improving your customer support team’s access to up-to-date customer information, and more.

Once the integration is set up, you can trigger the following Zendesk actions inside your Workflows. _Note: If there are multiple options for these actions, choose the one with "OAuth" in the name._

-   Create Zendesk Ticket
-   Update Zendesk Ticket
-   Add Tags to Zendesk Ticket
-   Remove Tags from Zendesk Ticket
