A Persona Inquiry represents a single instance of an individual attempting to verify their identity. Inquiries are created when the individual begins to verify their identity, and contains the information collected from the submitted verifications, the results of those verifications, and passively-collected contextual data like IP address that can be used to identify suspicious activity.

If the necessary verifications are passed and a manual review is not required, an Inquiry can be officially approved - some users refer to this as auto-approving. The Approve Inquiry step is useful for automatically triggering Inquiry approval after certain checks have been passed and business logic is conducted within your Workflow.
