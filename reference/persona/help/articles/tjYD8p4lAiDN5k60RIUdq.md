# I'm in the Startup Program, how do I add an Inquiry template?

On [Persona's Startup Program](../../landing/blog/free-identity-verification.md), you can't add Inquiry templates directly, but you can add solutions. To learn more, see: [How to add a solution](./67J7FurQtIgwxkWWvUropu.md).

On the Startup Program, you can use the following solutions in production:

-   Basic Verification using Government ID
-   KYC
