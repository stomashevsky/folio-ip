# Using filters and saved views of Transactions

## Overview[](#overview)

Saved Views let you create customized views of the Transactions index page, giving you access to commonly filtered lists of transactions. Whether you want to focus on transactions from certain date range, you can filter and save views that align with your business processes.

## Default view[](#default-view)

From the Dashboard, navigate to **Transactions > All Transactions** to open the Transactions index page. By default, the page opens on the **Default view**, where you can search, apply filters, and adjust the layout.

The Default view is a sorted view of all transactions from the most recently created transaction to the oldest created transactions. The Default view does not have any specified filters but you can add additional filters as needed. And if you find yourself applying the same set of filters repeatedly, consider saving that configuration as a **Saved View**.

## What you can configure in a saved view[](#what-you-can-configure-in-a-saved-view)

Saved Views make it easy to return to your preferred filters with a single click, instead of re-creating them each time. Your Transaction list view offers several configurable components:

-   **Filters** applied to each view
-   Ability to add multiple filters

## Filtering Transactions[](#filtering-transactions)

To filter your Transaction list view and display only the items that meet your criteria:

1.  Open the **filter menu** (toggle button with three lines to the right of the search bar).

2.  Apply filters such as:
    
    1.  Date created: Narrow results to transactions created within a specific date or date range.

    2.  Date updated: Narrow results to transactions created within a specific date or date range.

3.  To add more than one filter, hover next to the last filter row until the **“+” button** appears, then click it to add another filter.

## Creating saved views of filtered Transactions[](#creating-saved-views-of-filtered-transactions)

If you’ve applied filters in the Default view and want to save them for future use, you’ll need to create a new view:

1.  Hover next to **Default view** until the **“+” button** appears.

2.  Click the button to create your view.
3.  Give the view a **name**.
4.  Use the drop-down menu to **duplicate, save, or delete** the view. Access this menu later by hovering over the view name and selecting the **three-dot menu.**

5.  Once you’ve configured your filters, click **Save view** to preserve your setup for later.

If the **Save view** button is inactive, you may not have applied filters that differ from the Default view.

## Managing saved views[](#managing-saved-views)

To edit a saved view:

1.  Navigate to **Transactions > All Transactions**.
2.  Select the saved view from the existing views.

3.  Adjust filters, columns, or other settings as needed.
4.  Click **Save view** to apply your changes.

Your updates will overwrite the existing saved view, so you’ll see the new configuration the next time you open it.

## Items per page[](#items-per-page)

At the bottom of the Transactions index page, you can control how many transactions are displayed at once. Use the **Items per page** dropdown to select from the available options: **10, 25, 50, 100, or 200**.

Adjusting this setting is helpful if you want to:

-   View more transactions on a single page when scanning large datasets.
-   Limit the number of transactions displayed for easier navigation.

Your selection will update the table immediately.
