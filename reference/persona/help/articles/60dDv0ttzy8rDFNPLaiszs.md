# Business Classification Report

## Overview[](#overview)

The Business Classification Report classifies a given business into their industry (or industries) based on business name and website. Industry classification is based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes or Merchant Category Codes (MCC).

The report analyzes a business's online presence to determine the most relevant codes. Organizations can use the report to also flag high-risk industries based on factors such as reputational risk, fraud risk, legal risk, etc.

Knowing the industry in which a business operates is crucial for various aspects of customer onboarding, underwriting, and monitoring. Often times, customers have compliance requirements for doing business with certain flagged and regulated industries. For some customers, they want to outright decline businesses that fall in any of these categories.
