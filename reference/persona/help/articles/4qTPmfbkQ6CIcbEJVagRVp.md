# Availability Status in Cases

## About Availability status[](#about-availability-status)

The availability status feature lets you assign Cases to team members only when they're available.

### Adapt to your team's shifts and out-of-office[](#adapt-to-your-teams-shifts-and-out-of-office)

You can use availability status to manage Case assignments around your team's shifts and out-of-office schedules.

### Avoid bottlenecks[](#avoid-bottlenecks)

Assigning Cases to busy or unavailable team members can cause bottlenecks for your team and delays for your customers. Avoid these problems when you assign Cases according to your team's availability status.

## How it works[](#how-it-works)

Each user on your Cases review team can set their availability status to one of the three options below:

-   **Available:** Agent is available for new cases to be assigned.
-   **Busy:** No new cases will be assigned and existing cases will not be unassigned.
-   **Unavailable:** Agent is not available. All assigned cases will be unassigned.
