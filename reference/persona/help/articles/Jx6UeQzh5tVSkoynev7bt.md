## About Embedded Flow[](#about-embedded-flow)

With Persona's Embedded Flow integration method (also known as Web SDK), your end users can verify themselves without leaving their current experience on your web page. With a short code snippet, Embedded Flow lets you embed Persona's UI as a drop-in module within your web page. The module appears as an overlay on top of your page. Persona's Embedded Flow is both mobile and desktop compatible.
