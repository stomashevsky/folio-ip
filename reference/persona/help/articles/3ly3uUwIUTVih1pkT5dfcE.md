# Workflows: Create Case step

# What is the Create Case step?[](#what-is-the-create-case-step)

**Create Case** is a Workflow Action step that creates a new Case when triggered.

Cases are Persona products that collect together data on an end user to allow for manual investigation and decisioning on.

Your organization may need to investigate a user using a Case for a variety of reasons:

-   **Onboarding**: Should this user be allowed to onboard to the platform?
-   **Account takeover investigation**: If a user is claiming that their account has been taken over, is there enough information to validate their claim?
-   **Fraudulent activity**: Are there suspicious signals associated with this user that require further action (e.g. account freezing, sending a follow-up inquiry for verification, etc.)?
-   **Transaction monitoring review**: Are there suspicious transactions associated with this user that require further investigation?

The Create Case step is useful for automatically triggering Case creation when certain parameters are met in your Workflow.
