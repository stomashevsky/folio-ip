# How do I contact Support?

You can get in touch with Support in a number of ways:

-   Contact via the [Dashboard Contact Us page](https://app.withpersona.com/dashboard/contact-us)
-   Select the **Submit a request** link in this Help Center.
-   If you are not a customer yet, you can [contact us here](../../../landing/contact.md).

Here are some special situations:

-   To easily report an issue related to a specific Inquiry, use the Persona Dashboard. You can report extraction errors, suspected fraud, and other issues. See [this guide](../4hBzcoBM9lVCMZv6PFw31V.md) for details.
-   If your organization works with a Customer Success Manager, you can reach out to them instead of Support.
