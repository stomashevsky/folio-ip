# Workflows: Fetch Persona Object step

**Fetch Persona Object** is a Workflow Action step that retrieves a specific Persona object, such as an Inquiry, Case, or Transaction, based on its unique ID.

Once the Fetch Persona Object step retrieves that object, you can access the current state and details of the object within your workflow, enabling you to make informed decisions or trigger subsequent actions based on the retrieved data.

This step is very useful for letting your workflow affect and access the rest of your organization’s data, and take informed actions as a result. It also allows you to modify an object’s state and details from within your workflow, even if the object was not created within the same workflow.
