# What are Case Notifications?

# Overview[](#overview)

Case Notifications alert you when something changes in a Case you’re responsible for. You can receive a notification when:

-   A Case is assigned to you.
-   A Case that is assigned to you has an [SLA breach](./5JQzBlB1uHQkyXLpysk1W1.md).
-   You are tagged in a Case comment.

Notifications appear in your Dashboard and/or email based on your personal notification settings.

There is a separate notification setting for when any new Case is created using a specific Case Template. See [Cases Template](./5WFMyVPjzgXQNljqg2xf4h.md) to learn more.
