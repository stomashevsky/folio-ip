# Workflows: Parallel step

# What is the Parallel step?[](#what-is-the-parallel-step)

**Parallel** is a Workflow step that allows you to split your Workflow into parallel workflow routes that will all execute synchronously.

The Parallel step is useful for conducting several operations in tandem, such as running several different security reports on an Inquiry.

Each branch funnels into the same shared next step, which can be informed by the results of the parallel steps.

⚠️ The Parallel step is not conditional, which means all of its parallel branches proceed and execute simultaneously.

To add a conditional statement where only certain branches will execute depending on the conditions, use the Conditional step instead.
