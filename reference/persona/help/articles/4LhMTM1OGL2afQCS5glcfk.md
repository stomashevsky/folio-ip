# Why isn't the barcode being captured clearly?

⚠️ Note: This guide is for individuals going through a Persona-powered identity verification flow. While we’ve included helpful tips, the verification was set up by the business, service, or organization that asked you to verify. They use Persona as a tool, and they ultimately decide what’s required and can assist with your specific situation, if you’re having trouble.

Barcodes are very detailed, so high-quality images are required to decode the barcode from your ID. Image resolution, image focus, lighting, and noise can all impact barcode scans.

To increase the quality of your photos, try the following steps:

-   If you are using a desktop computer, switch to a mobile device. Mobile phones have higher quality cameras than desktop computers.
-   Adjust your lighting. Position the barcode so that it is not backlit. Reduce any glare.
-   Hold the camera or ID as still as possible.
