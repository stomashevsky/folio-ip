# How do I manually redact PII from a Persona Account or Inquiry?

In the Persona Dashboard, you can manually redact all PII associated with a Persona Account or PII specific to individual Inquiries. This article walks you through the steps for both processes.

⚠️ **Should I redact PII from an Account or from an individual Inquiry?**

| **Action** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- |
| **Redacting PII on the Account level** | By redacting PII on an Account, you will irreversibly redact all its associated Inquiry PII. |
| **Redacting PII from an individual Inquiry** | If you redact PII from a single Inquiry, you will not prompt Persona to auto-redact PII from any other Inquiry associated with the associated Account. |

### Important tips[](#important-tips)

🛑 **Persona cannot recover redacted information.** All redactions are irreversible.

-   **Redacting on the Account level will automatically and permanently redact all PII associated with the Account, including all Inquiries associated with the Account**.
-   If you redact PII from a single Inquiry, Persona will not automatically redact all PII from the Persona Account with which the Inquiry is associated.

# Redact all PII associated with a Persona Account[](#redact-all-pii-associated-with-a-persona-account)

Redacting on the Account level will automatically and irreversibly redact PII from **all** associated Inquiries.

⚠️ You need to be signed into your Persona account to proceed.

## Find the Account from which you want to redact information[](#find-the-account-from-which-you-want-to-redact-information)

Using the Dashboard search bar, search for an Account by its [RefID](../../docs/docs/reference-ids.md), the unique identifier provided by your organization to identify the Account.

❓ **Can you use another unique identifier?** You can also use an Inquiry ID and an Account ID, but we don’t recommend it. The Inquiry ID will return individual Inquiries and the Account ID is the Account token, which is generated by Persona.

# Redact PII from a single Inquiry[](#redact-pii-from-a-single-inquiry)

You may need to redact PII from a one or multiple Inquiries while keeping some Inquiries intact. The following section explains how to do so.

## Find the Inquiry from which you want to redact information[](#find-the-inquiry-from-which-you-want-to-redact-information)

You can find an individual Inquiry by under All Inquiries, but you may be able to find it faster by searching Persona for the Inquiry or the Account with which it’s associated.

If you have the Inquiry ID, you can search for the Inquiry itself. Your second option is to search for the Account, which will display all associated Inquiries, so that you can decide which Inquiries to redact.

### Search for the Inquiry[](#search-for-the-inquiry)

Using the Dashboard search bar, search for an Inquiry by its [Inquiry ID](../../docs/reference/retrieve-an-inquiry.md), the unique identifier that Persona associates with each Inquiry. If you don’t have it, see the next section.
