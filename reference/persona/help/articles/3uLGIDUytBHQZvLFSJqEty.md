Why are my users seeing an error message that says “You need to enable JavaScript to use the Persona Inquiry flow” on the Government ID or Selfie step when they go through an Inquiry?

Hi there! This is a great question!

If only some of your users are experiencing this error message (or you’re hearing about this issue intermittently) within an Inquiry, then a common culprit is that some of your users may have JavaScript disabled in their browsers.

For added context, JavaScript is a scripting language that enables most of the interactive elements on web pages. When an end user has JavaScript disabled, certain features and functionalities on the website may not work correctly or may be inaccessible.

Additionally, depending on how you’ve chosen to integrate with Persona (i.e. this is not an issue for mobile SDKs), this can affect what the user experience.

It’s relatively rare for users to have JavaScript disabled but of course, this is dependent upon your business and what your users or customers.

For most people, JavaScript is enabled by default, meaning that the vast majority of visitors will experience your site as intended.
